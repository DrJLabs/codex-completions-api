Before landing a change, run the tests dictated by the touched area: src/utils.js → npm run test:unit; server.js/handlers → npm run test:integration then npm test; Dockerfile or Traefik/compose changes → npm run smoke:prod plus e2e; Dockerfile/runtime image → npm run dev:stack:up and e2e. Always run npm run verify:all ahead of PRs when practical and record curl smoke results when touching routing/streaming. Document change summary + tests before opening/updating PRs.
