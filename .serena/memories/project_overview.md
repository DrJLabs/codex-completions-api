Codex Completions API is an Express-based Node.js proxy that mimics OpenAI's Chat Completions API so existing OpenAI clients can talk to Codex CLI with minimal changes. The server exposes /healthz, /v1/models, and /v1/chat/completions (with SSE streaming) and normalizes requested model IDs (codex-5*/codev-5*) to Codex gpt-5 before spawning the CLI. Ancillary pieces include a Traefik ForwardAuth service (auth/server.mjs), docker-compose + systemd units for deployment, and config samples for Codex providers.
