## Epic 1: App-Server Platform Foundation

### Expanded Goal

Lay the groundwork for running the Codex App Server alongside the existing proxy by introducing a supervised worker, dual-mode configuration, and baseline transport plumbing so later epics can focus on parity and rollout without touching infrastructure.

### Stories

**Story 1.1: Add app-server feature flag scaffold**

As an operator,
I want the proxy to support a runtime switch between proto and app-server,
So that we can enable or disable the new backend without redeploying.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Environment variable (e.g., `PROXY_USE_APP_SERVER`) toggles backend selection at startup.
2. Configuration docs outline defaults for dev, staging, and prod.
3. Unit tests cover both flag paths and ensure default matches current proto behavior.

**Prerequisites:** None

**Story 1.2: Package Codex CLI with app-server capability**

As a platform engineer,
I want the runtime image to include the required Codex CLI version and assets,
So that the proxy can launch the app-server worker reliably across environments.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Dockerfile installs/pins Codex CLI >= 0.49 with JSON-RPC support.
2. Container image exposes `CODEX_HOME` writable path without leaking secrets.
3. Verify CLI availability via smoke script inside container build/test stage.

**Prerequisites:** Story 1.1

**Story 1.3: Implement worker supervisor and lifecycle hooks**

As a backend developer,
I want a supervised process that starts, restarts, and terminates the Codex App Server cleanly,
So that the API can rely on a persistent worker without manual intervention.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Proxy boots the worker on startup and captures stdout/stderr for structured logging.
2. Restart policy handles crash loops with bounded backoff and surfaces failure metrics.
3. Graceful shutdown drains requests and terminates the worker within configured timeout.

**Prerequisites:** Stories 1.1-1.2

**Story 1.4: Establish JSON-RPC transport channel**

As an application developer,
I want the proxy to open and maintain the JSON-RPC connection to the worker,
So that higher-level adapters can send requests without reimplementing transport details.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Connection handshake validates worker readiness and model advertisements.
2. Transport handles request IDs, timeouts, and retryable failures consistently.
3. Integration test proves a mock request/response round-trip through the channel.

**Prerequisites:** Stories 1.1-1.3

**Story 1.5: Wire readiness and liveness probes to worker state**

As an SRE,
I want health endpoints to reflect the workerâ€™s status,
So that orchestrators only route traffic when the app-server is actually available.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Liveness probe reports process availability; readiness waits for successful handshake.
2. Probe configuration documented for docker-compose and systemd deployments.
3. Failing worker causes readiness to flip false within 5 seconds.

**Prerequisites:** Stories 1.3-1.4

**Story 1.6: Document foundation and operational controls**

As a product operator,
I want runbooks and docs explaining the new worker controls,
So that teams know how to configure environments during later rollout.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. README/runbook updates describe feature flag usage, CLI requirements, and health checks.
2. Environment variable matrix added to config docs (`dev`, `staging`, `prod`).
3. Change log highlights migration readiness for partner teams.

**Prerequisites:** Stories 1.1-1.5

## Epic 2: `/v1/chat/completions` JSON-RPC Parity

### Expanded Goal

So that Epic 2 development can rely on fast regression feedback and confident cutover readiness.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Transcript capture tooling records paired proto and app-server outputs for baseline chat, streaming, tool-call, and error scenarios, normalizing dynamic fields and storing version metadata in the repo.
2. A parity diff harness runs in CI, comparing the paired fixtures with developer-friendly diagnostics, failing when transcripts diverge or required scenarios are missing.
3. The Epic 1 app-server baseline is deployed and smoke-tested, with the capture process documented so fixtures reflect production-ready behavior.

**Prerequisites:** Epic 1 stories delivering transport channel and worker lifecycle.

**Story 2.1: Define JSON-RPC schema bindings for chat**
