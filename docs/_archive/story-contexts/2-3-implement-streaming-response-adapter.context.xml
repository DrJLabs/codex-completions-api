    <asA>As an application developer. [Source](docs/_archive/stories/2-3-implement-streaming-response-adapter.md#story)</asA>
    <iWant>I want JSON-RPC streaming events converted back into SSE deltas. [Source](docs/_archive/stories/2-3-implement-streaming-response-adapter.md#story)</iWant>
    <soThat>So that clients observe identical role/token sequencing. [Source](docs/epics.md#story-23-implement-streaming-response-adapter)</soThat>
    <tasks>
- [x] (AC #1) Implement JSON-RPC streaming adapter in `src/handlers/chat/stream.js`, subscribing to `agentMessageDelta`, `agentMessage`, and `tokenCount` notifications and emitting matching SSE chunks plus `[DONE]`. [Source](docs/_archive/stories/2-3-implement-streaming-response-adapter.md#tasks--subtasks)
  - [x] (AC #1) Integrate transport hooks via `createJsonRpcChildAdapter`/`appServerClient` so streaming context reuses Story 2.2 normalization outputs without duplicating request bookkeeping. [Source](docs/_archive/stories/2-3-implement-streaming-response-adapter.md#tasks--subtasks)
  - [x] (AC #1) Handle tool-call payloads and usage accumulation while respecting concurrency guard and disconnect semantics already enforced by the SSE gateway. [Source](docs/_archive/stories/2-3-implement-streaming-response-adapter.md#tasks--subtasks)
- [x] (AC #2) Record first-token and total stream latency plus usage metrics, emitting structured logs and Prometheus updates before closing responses. [Source](docs/_archive/stories/2-3-implement-streaming-response-adapter.md#tasks--subtasks)
  - [x] (AC #2) Ensure aggregated usage surfaces in final SSE `[DONE]` and non-stream fallback paths consistent with FR002/FR004. [Source](docs/_archive/stories/2-3-implement-streaming-response-adapter.md#tasks--subtasks)
- [x] (AC #3) Extend parity tests (`tests/integration/chat-jsonrpc.int.test.js` + golden fixture harness) to compare proto vs. app-server streaming transcripts and fail on ordering or finish-reason drift. [Source](docs/_archive/stories/2-3-implement-streaming-response-adapter.md#tasks--subtasks)
  - [x] (AC #3) Update `scripts/fake-codex-jsonrpc.js` and captured fixtures so tool-call and error streams exercise the adapter. [Source](docs/_archive/stories/2-3-implement-streaming-response-adapter.md#tasks--subtasks)
    </tasks>

  <acceptanceCriteria>
1. Streaming adapter consumes `agentMessageDelta`, `agentMessage`, and `tokenCount` notifications from the JSON-RPC transport and emits OpenAI-compatible SSE deltas, tool-call blocks, and terminal `[DONE]` events without altering existing payload shapes. [Source](docs/_archive/stories/2-3-implement-streaming-response-adapter.md#acceptance-criteria) [Source](docs/epics.md#story-23-implement-streaming-response-adapter) [Source](docs/app-server-migration/codex-completions-api-migration.md#d-streaming-path-sse)
2. Adapter records per-request first-token and total latency, propagates usage totals, and logs structured telemetry consistent with current observability patterns before closing the stream. [Source](docs/_archive/stories/2-3-implement-streaming-response-adapter.md#acceptance-criteria) [Source](docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md#performance) [Source](docs/architecture.md#integration-points)
3. Deterministic parity evidence covers streaming scenarios: golden transcript diff passes for baseline + tool-call flows, and integration tests fail if delta ordering or finish reasons diverge. [Source](docs/_archive/stories/2-3-implement-streaming-response-adapter.md#acceptance-criteria) [Source](docs/test-design-epic-2.md#test-coverage-plan) [Source](docs/openai-endpoint-golden-parity.md#54-streaming-sse--golden-chunk-pattern)

    <ideas>
- AC #1: Add JSON-RPC streaming integration test asserting deltas emitted by `src/handlers/chat/stream.js` match expected SSE frames for baseline and tool-call transcripts.
- AC #2: Instrument integration tests to capture latency metrics and usage totals, verifying logs/Prometheus counters update before stream closure.
- AC #3: Expand parity fixtures to cover streaming scenarios and run `diff-fixtures` to fail builds when chunk ordering or finish reasons drift.
