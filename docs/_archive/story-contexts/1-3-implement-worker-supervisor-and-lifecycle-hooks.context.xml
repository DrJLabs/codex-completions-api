    <iWant>a supervised process that starts, restarts, and terminates the Codex App Server cleanly</iWant>
    <soThat>the API can rely on a persistent worker without manual intervention</soThat>
    <tasks>- AC#1 – Introduce a supervisor module under `src/services/worker/` to start and monitor the Codex App Server.
  - Create lifecycle orchestration that boots the worker during startup and streams stdout/stderr through structured logging.
  - Hook supervisor bootstrap into the app-server feature flag path and reuse the packaged CLI plus workdir from Story 1.2.
  - Extend integration coverage to confirm supervisor boot logs and readiness gating.
- AC#2 – Implement bounded restart/backoff handling with metrics and structured warnings.
  - Emit restart telemetry (for example, `codex_worker_restarts_total`, `codex_worker_latency_ms`) and include exit codes/backoff windows in logs.
  - Add unit coverage for the backoff scheduler and integration scenarios that simulate crash loops.
- AC#3 – Deliver graceful shutdown and request draining.
  - Toggle readiness false, drain in-flight requests, and enforce `WORKER_SHUTDOWN_GRACE_MS` prior to terminating the worker.
  - Surface retriable errors for drained requests and restore readiness once the worker handshake succeeds.
  - Add integration/E2E coverage for SIGTERM handling and health endpoint behavior.</tasks>

  <acceptanceCriteria>1. Worker supervisor boots the shared Codex App Server on proxy startup, funnels stdout/stderr into structured logging, and keeps observability hooks active across lifecycle events. (docs/epics.md#story-13-implement-worker-supervisor-and-lifecycle-hooks; docs/architecture.md#implementation-patterns)
2. Supervisor restarts the worker with bounded exponential backoff, exposing restart metrics and warnings so operators can detect crash loops. (docs/epics.md#story-13-implement-worker-supervisor-and-lifecycle-hooks; docs/architecture.md#implementation-patterns)
3. Shutdown drains in-flight work, updates readiness, and terminates the worker within the configured grace period while presenting retriable errors to clients. (docs/epics.md#story-13-implement-worker-supervisor-and-lifecycle-hooks; docs/PRD.md#user-journeys)</acceptanceCriteria>

    <code>- src/services/codex-runner.js#L1-L60 — Current Codex process spawner; supervisor can wrap this to ensure shared worker lifecycle and workdir preparation.
- src/services/backend-mode.js#L1-L80 — Feature flag resolver that toggles proto vs app-server; supervisor bootstrap must defer to this mode.
- server.js#L1-L40 — HTTP bootstrap and signal handlers; extend to start the supervisor early and coordinate graceful shutdown.
- src/routes/health.js#L1-L40 — `/healthz` route that reports backend state; requires augmentation to reflect worker readiness and failure conditions.
- src/app.js#L1-L140 — Express factory wiring routers and middleware; potential insertion point for supervisor-backed readiness/maintenance gates.
- src/services/concurrency-guard.js#L1-L80 — Provides concurrency snapshots that can integrate with worker capacity management.
- tests/integration/routes.health.int.test.js#L1-L80 — Existing health endpoint coverage to expand with worker readiness assertions.
- tests/integration/server.int.test.js#L1-L120 — Server bootstrap tests verifying graceful shutdown behavior, useful when adding supervisor drains.</code>
    <dependencies>- Container base image `node:22-alpine` (Dockerfile) provides the Node 22 runtime the supervisor must target for process and signal APIs.
- Runtime packages: `@openai/codex@0.53.0` (shared app-server binary), `express@^4.21.2` (HTTP stack), and `nanoid@^5.1.6` (request IDs) from package.json.
- Test/tooling packages: `vitest@^4.0.3`, `@playwright/test@^1.56.1`, and `get-port@^7.0.0` (integration harness) shape the verification environment for supervisor lifecycle tests.
- Observability and lint tooling (ESLint, Prettier, Secretlint) remain part of the verification chain invoked by `npm run verify:all`.</dependencies>
  </artifacts>

  <constraints>- Maintain writable `.codex-api/` state and avoid bundling secrets when launching the worker, matching deployment safeguards. (docs/architecture.md#deployment-architecture; docs/_archive/stories/1-2-package-codex-cli-with-app-server-capability.md#completion-notes-list)
- Follow architecture logging/metrics conventions—structured JSON logs plus Prometheus-style counters—for every supervisor lifecycle event. (docs/architecture.md#implementation-patterns)
- Respect the `PROXY_USE_APP_SERVER` feature flag so proto remains available during rollout toggles. (docs/app-server-migration/codex-completions-api-migration.md#b-process-model-change-singleton-child; src/services/backend-mode.js#L1-L80)
- Meet PRD restart expectations: restart within ~10 seconds, readiness healthy inside 8 seconds, and return retriable errors during drains. (docs/PRD.md#user-journeys)</constraints>
  <interfaces>- Supervisor ↔ `codex-runner` (`src/services/codex-runner.js`) to spawn and manage the shared `codex app-server` child with consistent env/cwd.
- Supervisor ↔ HTTP bootstrap (`server.js`) so startup waits for worker readiness and SIGTERM/SIGINT trigger draining before process exit.
- Supervisor ↔ health/readiness routes (`src/routes/health.js`, future `/readyz`) to expose worker status, restart counters, and failure reasons.
- Supervisor ↔ configuration surface (`src/config/index.js`) for timeouts, backoff windows, and feature flags.
- Supervisor ↔ telemetry pipeline (structured logs + planned metrics export) to feed observability and alerting described in architecture docs.</interfaces>
  <tests>
    <standards>Follow the repo-standard pipeline: Vitest unit tests for helpers, Vitest integration tests for HTTP/worker lifecycle, Playwright E2E for streaming/parity, plus smoke scripts that exercise `codex app-server --help` before verification. (docs/bmad/architecture/tech-stack.md#testing--qa)</standards>

    <ideas>- AC#1 – Add integration coverage that boots the proxy with `PROXY_USE_APP_SERVER=true`, asserts supervisor log lines, and confirms `/healthz` reports `app_server_enabled: true` only after the worker handshake.
- AC#2 – Simulate repeated worker crashes by pointing `CODEX_BIN` at a stub that exits immediately; verify bounded backoff, restart metrics, and warning logs.
- AC#3 – Issue SIGTERM during active streaming requests in Playwright to ensure responses drain gracefully, readiness flips to false, and clients receive retryable errors.</ideas>
