    <asA>As a QA engineer. [Source](docs/_archive/stories/2-5-update-regression-suite-for-parity-evidence.md#story)</asA>
    <iWant>I want automated regression tests capturing proto vs app-server behavior. [Source](docs/_archive/stories/2-5-update-regression-suite-for-parity-evidence.md#story)</iWant>
    <soThat>So that we can prove no regressions before rollout. [Source](docs/epics.md#story-25-update-regression-suite-for-parity-evidence) [Source](docs/PRD.md#functional-requirements)</soThat>
    <tasks>
- [ ] (AC #1) Expand deterministic parity coverage across unit and integration suites using existing JSON-RPC shims and the parity harness. [Source](docs/_archive/stories/2-5-update-regression-suite-for-parity-evidence.md#tasks--subtasks)
  - [ ] (AC #1) Add or refine parity scenarios in `tests/parity/` and `tests/integration/` to cover baseline, streaming delta, and error/tool-call cases. [Source](docs/_archive/stories/2-5-update-regression-suite-for-parity-evidence.md#tasks--subtasks)
  - [ ] (AC #1) Regenerate transcripts via `npm run transcripts:generate` and validate diffs with `npm run test:parity` before committing fixture updates. [Source](docs/_archive/stories/2-5-update-regression-suite-for-parity-evidence.md#tasks--subtasks)
- [ ] (AC #2) Ensure `npm run test:integration`, `npm test`, and related scripts exercise the app-server path with refreshed fixtures and document the expected commands. [Source](docs/_archive/stories/2-5-update-regression-suite-for-parity-evidence.md#tasks--subtasks)
  - [ ] (AC #2) Update integration/E2E setup so the app-server transport is active during regression runs. [Source](docs/_archive/stories/2-5-update-regression-suite-for-parity-evidence.md#tasks--subtasks)
  - [ ] (AC #2) Capture command outputs (or CI references) proving `npm run test:integration`, `npm test`, and `npm run test:parity` succeed after fixture rotation. [Source](docs/_archive/stories/2-5-update-regression-suite-for-parity-evidence.md#tasks--subtasks)
- [ ] (AC #3) Publish parity comparison artifacts and CLI metadata alongside documentation updates so audit trails remain complete. [Source](docs/_archive/stories/2-5-update-regression-suite-for-parity-evidence.md#tasks--subtasks)
  - [ ] (AC #3) Update parity documentation with new scenario coverage, CLI version stamps, and artifact locations. [Source](docs/_archive/stories/2-5-update-regression-suite-for-parity-evidence.md#tasks--subtasks)
  - [ ] (AC #3) Verify CI uploads parity diff outputs and metadata (e.g., transcripts manifest) for release evidence. [Source](docs/_archive/stories/2-5-update-regression-suite-for-parity-evidence.md#tasks--subtasks)

  <acceptanceCriteria>
1. Unit and integration suites run against deterministic JSON-RPC mocks that cover baseline, streaming, and error parity scenarios identified for Story 2.5, preventing regressions before rollout. [Source](docs/_archive/stories/2-5-update-regression-suite-for-parity-evidence.md#acceptance-criteria) [Source](docs/epics.md#story-25-update-regression-suite-for-parity-evidence) [Source](docs/test-design-epic-2.md#test-coverage-plan)
2. `npm run test:integration`, `npm test`, and `npm run test:parity` execute the app-server path using refreshed fixtures, producing passing results after transcripts regeneration. [Source](docs/_archive/stories/2-5-update-regression-suite-for-parity-evidence.md#acceptance-criteria) [Source](docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md#acceptance-criteria-authoritative) [Source](docs/openai-endpoint-golden-parity.md#81-capture-workflow-proto--app-server-parity)
3. CI and documentation capture parity comparison artifacts and CLI metadata (including fixture versions) in the repo-standard locations, keeping parity evidence audit-ready.

    <code>
- path: tests/parity/chat-fixture-parity.test.mjs | type: file | lineHint: describe("chat fixture parity") | reason: Enforces proto vs. app transcript equality for every REQUIRED_TRANSCRIPTS scenario and should be extended with any new fixtures.

- path: tests/integration/chat-jsonrpc.int.test.js | type: file | lineHint: describe("chat JSON-RPC parity") | reason: Houses deterministic integration cases for JSON-RPC parity; add baseline/streaming/error regressions surfaced in Story 2.5.

  <constraints>
- Preserve deterministic proto vs. app transcripts with metadata (scenario, backend, CLI version) per parity workflow; failing to regenerate breaks Story 2.5 evidence. [Source](docs/openai-endpoint-golden-parity.md#81-capture-workflow-proto--app-server-parity)
- Record parity outputs, CLI version, and test logs in repo-standard locations as mandated by the migration runbook and PRD FR013–FR015. [Source](docs/app-server-migration/codex-completions-api-migration.md#k-parity-fixture-maintenance-workflow) [Source](docs/PRD.md#functional-requirements)
- Keep `@openai/codex` pinned to 0.53.0 and reuse the existing harness/scripts instead of introducing new tooling. [Source](package.json) [Source](docs/test-design-epic-2.md#test-coverage-plan)

    <standards>Follow Epic 2 test plan: parity baseline, streaming delta, and error suites run as P0; transcript regeneration and version enforcement tracked as P1, with outputs archived per migration workflow.

    <ideas>
- AC #1: Add parity harness coverage for new scenarios (e.g., streaming tool calls, failure fixtures) ensuring proto/app JSON bodies remain identical.
- AC #2: Extend integration tests to execute with `PROXY_USE_APP_SERVER=true`, capturing logs/attachments for `npm run test:integration`, `npm test`, and parity command outputs.
- AC #3: Automate artifact publication (transcript manifests, CLI version stamps) and add checks that CI uploads the generated evidence bundle.
