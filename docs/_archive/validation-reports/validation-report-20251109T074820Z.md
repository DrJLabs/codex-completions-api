- Critical Issues: 0

## Section Results

### Source & Citation Coverage — Pass Rate: 7/7 (100%)
- ✓ **PASS** – Tech spec, PRD, architecture, epics, and tool-call design docs all cited with anchors (docs/_archive/stories/2-9-stream-and-nonstream-tool-calls.md:55-73).  
- ✓ **PASS** – References list now includes the tech-stack runtime guide with anchor plus anchored entries for every other document (docs/_archive/stories/2-9-stream-and-nonstream-tool-calls.md:118-126).

### Task & Testing Traceability — Pass Rate: 42/42 (100%)
- ✓ **PASS** – Implementation tasks enumerate AC #1‑#21 with explicit `(AC: #n)` tags (docs/_archive/stories/2-9-stream-and-nonstream-tool-calls.md:34-95).  
- ✓ **PASS** – Each implementation task has a paired testing subtask referencing the same AC, giving ≥21 dedicated testing bullets as required (docs/_archive/stories/2-9-stream-and-nonstream-tool-calls.md:36-97).

### Previous Story Continuity & Learnings — Pass Rate: 4/4 (100%)
- ✓ **PASS** – Learnings cite Story 2.8 sections with anchors, covering artifacts, helper guidance, and completion evidence (docs/_archive/stories/2-9-stream-and-nonstream-tool-calls.md:74-83).  
- ✓ **PASS** – Sprint status confirms Story 2.8 is done and no unresolved review items remain (docs/sprint-status.yaml:24-40; docs/_archive/stories/2-8-implement-tool-call-aggregator.md:90-125).

### Structural & Metadata Checks — Pass Rate: 6/6 (100%)
- ✓ **PASS** – Story remains in drafted status with proper story statement and initialized Dev Agent Record lists (docs/_archive/stories/2-9-stream-and-nonstream-tool-calls.md:1-124).  
- ✓ **PASS** – Dev Notes now include architecture constraints referencing both implementation-patterns and tech-stack runtime defaults (docs/_archive/stories/2-9-stream-and-nonstream-tool-calls.md:90-103).

## Failed Items
_None_

## Partial Items
_None_

## Successes
1. Full AC-to-task and AC-to-testing traceability removes ambiguity for developers and reviewers (docs/_archive/stories/2-9-stream-and-nonstream-tool-calls.md:34-97).
2. References now capture all prerequisite architecture docs, including the tech-stack runtime guide that governs SSE/config expectations (docs/_archive/stories/2-9-stream-and-nonstream-tool-calls.md:118-126).
3. Learnings section explicitly anchors artifacts and completion evidence from Story 2.8, keeping continuity intact (docs/_archive/stories/2-9-stream-and-nonstream-tool-calls.md:74-83).
