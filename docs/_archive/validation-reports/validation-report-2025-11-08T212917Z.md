✓ Tasks/subtasks captured — bullet list mirrors story’s Tasks section (lines 16-20).  
✓ Relevant docs (5 entries) with snippets — documentation list cites scope/requirements with context (lines 49-53).  
✓ Code references with line hints and reasons — six entries list paths plus rationale (lines 54-59).  
✓ Interfaces/API contracts extracted — dedicated section enumerates aggregator, JSON-RPC notifications, and textual parser interfaces (lines 72-74).  
✓ Constraints include dev rules/patterns — section ties purity, architecture layout, and output-mode requirements to source docs (lines 67-71).  
✓ Dependencies detected from manifests/frameworks — runtime + test deps plus smoke harness covered (lines 60-64).  
✓ Testing standards and locations populated — standards, locations, and test ideas present (lines 76-80).

## Recommendations
1. Must Fix: None — document meets all checklist requirements.  
2. Should Improve: Optional future update once `docs/dev/tool-call-aggregator.md` exists to link actual file.  
3. Consider: Keep validation reports in sync when acceptance criteria evolve.
