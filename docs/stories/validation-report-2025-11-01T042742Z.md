Pass Rate: 10/10 (100%)

✓ Story fields (asA/iWant/soThat) captured  
Evidence: Lines 13-15 capture persona statement, goal, and benefit with canonical phrasing. (docs/stories/2-2-implement-request-translation-layer.context.xml#L13-L15)

✓ Acceptance criteria list matches story draft exactly (no invention)  
Evidence: Lines 28-31 replicate the story’s three acceptance criteria verbatim, including deterministic request identifiers and parity requirements. (docs/stories/2-2-implement-request-translation-layer.context.xml#L28-L31)

✓ Tasks/subtasks captured as task list  
Evidence: Lines 16-24 enumerate every task and nested subtask from the story draft using checkbox syntax. (docs/stories/2-2-implement-request-translation-layer.context.xml#L16-L24)

✓ Relevant docs (5-15) included with path and snippets  
Evidence: Lines 35-44 list nine documentation references with titles, sections, and concise snippets. (docs/stories/2-2-implement-request-translation-layer.context.xml#L35-L44)

✓ Relevant code references included with reason and line hints  
Evidence: Lines 47-52 cite implementation directories/files and explain their relevance to the translation layer. (docs/stories/2-2-implement-request-translation-layer.context.xml#L47-L52)

✓ Interfaces/API contracts extracted if applicable  
Evidence: Lines 67-69 document the Codex JSON-RPC API and connected services that consume translation outputs. (docs/stories/2-2-implement-request-translation-layer.context.xml#L67-L69)

✓ Constraints include applicable dev rules and patterns  
Evidence: Lines 60-64 record parity, concurrency, logging, and schema regeneration constraints sourced from core specs. (docs/stories/2-2-implement-request-translation-layer.context.xml#L60-L64)

✓ Dependencies detected from manifests and frameworks  
Evidence: Lines 55-56 outline Node version and npm packages necessary for the translation layer work. (docs/stories/2-2-implement-request-translation-layer.context.xml#L55-L56)

✓ Testing standards and locations populated  
Evidence: Lines 71-78 specify test strategy, path patterns, and scenario ideas aligned with Epic 2 QA guidance. (docs/stories/2-2-implement-request-translation-layer.context.xml#L71-L78)

✓ XML structure follows story-context template format  
Evidence: Document preserves `<story-context>` root with metadata, story, artifacts, constraints, interfaces, and tests sections matching the template (lines 1-80). (docs/stories/2-2-implement-request-translation-layer.context.xml#L1-L80)
