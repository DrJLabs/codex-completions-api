# Story Quality Validation Report

Story: 1-6-document-foundation-and-operational-controls - Document foundation and operational controls
Outcome: PASS with issues (Critical: 0, Major: 3, Minor: 0)

## Critical Issues (Blockers)

- None

## Major Issues (Should Fix)

- ⚠ Missing "Architecture patterns and constraints" subsection in Dev Notes
  - Evidence: Dev Notes (lines 41-46) list guidance bullets but no dedicated "Architecture patterns and constraints" subsection as required by the checklist.
- ⚠ Testing subtasks do not cover every acceptance criterion
  - Evidence: Tasks section lines 35-39 only include testing subtasks for AC #1 and AC #2; AC #3 lacks any testing coverage, leaving testing subtasks count (2) below AC count (3).
- ⚠ Coding standards reference missing despite available doc
  - Evidence: References section lines 60-65 omits `docs/bmad/architecture/coding-standards.md`, even though the document exists and checklist expects Dev Notes to reference standards when available.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Have)

- None

## Successes

- Story statement follows the expected As/I want/so that format with source citation (lines 7-9).
- Acceptance criteria mirror the Epic 1.6 requirements and include source references (lines 27-31).
- Tasks map to each acceptance criterion using (AC #) notation, providing clear implementation guidance (lines 35-39).
- Learnings from previous story cite Story 1.5 artifacts and highlight reusable tests (lines 48-52).
