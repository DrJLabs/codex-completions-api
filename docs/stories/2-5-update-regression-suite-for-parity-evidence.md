# Story 2.5: Update regression suite for parity evidence

Status: done

## Requirements Context Summary

- Epic 2 Story 2.5 requires deterministic JSON-RPC regression suites plus parity evidence before rollout, so automated coverage breadth and artifact capture are non-negotiable. [Source: docs/epics.md#story-25-update-regression-suite-for-parity-evidence]
- Tech spec acceptance criteria 5 binds this story to exercising `npm run test:integration`, `npm test`, and the parity harness with published artifacts and CLI metadata. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md#acceptance-criteria-authoritative]
- PRD FR013–FR015 reiterate that regression suites, smoke scripts, and deployment runbooks must be refreshed for the JSON-RPC backend. [Source: docs/PRD.md#functional-requirements]
- The parity companion spec outlines the canonical workflow to regenerate transcripts, run `npm run test:parity`, and record baseline versions for proto vs. app-server comparison. [Source: docs/openai-endpoint-golden-parity.md#81-capture-workflow-proto--app-server-parity]
- Migration runbook section K enforces capturing test outputs (`npm run test:integration`, `npm test`), parity diffs, and CLI metadata whenever fixtures update. [Source: docs/app-server-migration/codex-completions-api-migration.md#k-parity-fixture-maintenance-workflow]
- Epic 2 test design elevates parity baseline, streaming, and error suites plus version enforcement to P0/P1 quality gates that this story must satisfy. [Source: docs/test-design-epic-2.md#test-coverage-plan]

## Project Structure Alignment

- Reuse the parity harness, transcripts, and documentation introduced in Story 2.0—`tests/parity/chat-fixture-parity.test.mjs`, `test-results/chat-completions/{proto,app}/`, and `docs/test-design-epic-2.md`—instead of creating parallel artefacts. [Source: stories/2-0-establish-parity-verification-infrastructure.md#file-list]
- Extend integration coverage inside the existing `tests/integration/` tree and follow repository module boundaries set out in the source-tree guide. [Source: docs/bmad/architecture/source-tree.md#tests]
- Keep package scripts aligned with the documented QA toolchain so `npm run test:integration`, `npm test`, and `npm run test:parity` remain the authoritative regression commands. [Source: docs/bmad/architecture/tech-stack.md#testing--qa]
- When adding scenarios, centralise parity fixture guidance and evidence in `docs/openai-endpoint-golden-parity.md` for reviewers and QA. [Source: docs/openai-endpoint-golden-parity.md#81-capture-workflow-proto--app-server-parity]
- Document CLI metadata and release notes in the existing migration playbook to keep parity evidence cohesive. [Source: docs/app-server-migration/codex-completions-api-migration.md#k-parity-fixture-maintenance-workflow]

## Story

As a QA engineer,
I want automated regression tests capturing proto vs app-server behavior,
so that we can prove no regressions before rollout.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Unit and integration suites run against deterministic JSON-RPC mocks that cover baseline, streaming, and error parity scenarios identified for Story 2.5, preventing regressions before rollout. [Source: docs/epics.md#story-25-update-regression-suite-for-parity-evidence] [Source: docs/test-design-epic-2.md#test-coverage-plan]
2. `npm run test:integration`, `npm test`, and `npm run test:parity` execute the app-server path using refreshed fixtures, producing passing results after transcripts regeneration. [Source: docs/epics.md#story-25-update-regression-suite-for-parity-evidence] [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md#acceptance-criteria-authoritative] [Source: docs/openai-endpoint-golden-parity.md#81-capture-workflow-proto--app-server-parity]
3. CI and documentation capture parity comparison artifacts and CLI metadata (including fixture versions) in the repo-standard locations, keeping parity evidence audit-ready. [Source: docs/epics.md#story-25-update-regression-suite-for-parity-evidence] [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md#observability] [Source: docs/app-server-migration/codex-completions-api-migration.md#k-parity-fixture-maintenance-workflow]

## Dev Notes

- Extend `tests/parity/chat-fixture-parity.test.mjs` and related fixtures to cover the P0/P1 parity matrix while keeping deliberate mismatch drills for harness confidence. [Source: docs/test-design-epic-2.md#test-coverage-plan] [Source: docs/openai-endpoint-golden-parity.md#81-capture-workflow-proto--app-server-parity]
- Regenerate and sanitise transcripts through `scripts/generate-chat-transcripts.mjs`, ensuring CLI/App Server metadata stays embedded for audit trails. [Source: docs/app-server-migration/codex-completions-api-migration.md#k-parity-fixture-maintenance-workflow]
- Keep regression commands (`npm run test:integration`, `npm test`, `npm run test:parity`) wired into CI and record outputs or links alongside story evidence. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md#acceptance-criteria-authoritative] [Source: docs/bmad/architecture/tech-stack.md#testing--qa]
- Use PRD FR013–FR015 to coordinate updates across unit, integration, smoke, and runbook documentation whenever parity scenarios change. [Source: docs/PRD.md#functional-requirements]

### Learnings from Previous Story

- Story 2.4 (Align error handling and retries) hardened the transport error mapping and introduced negative-path fixtures across `src/services/transport/index.js`, `scripts/fake-codex-jsonrpc.js`, `tests/integration/chat-jsonrpc.int.test.js`, and `tests/unit/services/json-rpc-transport.spec.js`; treat those touch-points as regression seeds when broadening parity coverage. [Source: stories/2-4-align-error-handling-and-retries.md#Completion Notes List]
- Senior developer review for Story 2.4 cleared all blocking findings but noted an optional follow-up to broaden the transport error matrix; keep that advisory in mind when prioritising new parity scenarios. [Source: stories/2-4-align-error-handling-and-retries.md#Action Items]
- With the error-parity fixes merged in Story 2.4 and no unresolved review items remaining, this story can concentrate on expanding deterministic regression breadth rather than remediation. [Source: stories/2-4-align-error-handling-and-retries.md#Change Log]
- Parity infrastructure from Story 2.0 (fixtures, harness, documentation) remains the baseline; reuse those assets instead of creating parallel tooling. [Source: stories/2-0-establish-parity-verification-infrastructure.md#file-list]

### Dev Notes

#### Architecture patterns and constraints

- Maintain parity with the architecture guidance for error envelopes and supervisor retry semantics; reference `docs/architecture.md` (Error Handling, Implementation Patterns) when expanding regression checks so new scenarios continue to mirror proto behaviour. [Source: docs/architecture.md#Error Handling] [Source: docs/architecture.md#Implementation Patterns]
- Ensure regression artifacts capture CLI metadata and readiness signalling as mandated by the migration playbook to remain compliant with FR004/FR013. [Source: docs/app-server-migration/codex-completions-api-migration.md#k-parity-fixture-maintenance-workflow]

#### Testing and tooling workflow

- Keep parity updates inside `tests/parity/`, `tests/integration/`, and `test-results/` per the repository layout. [Source: docs/bmad/architecture/source-tree.md#tests]
- Use the documented test commands and tooling versions from the tech stack guide to stay on the supported QA toolchain. [Source: docs/bmad/architecture/tech-stack.md#testing--qa]
- Document fixture updates and CLI metadata in the existing parity docs to avoid configuration drift and satisfy CI evidence requirements. [Source: docs/openai-endpoint-golden-parity.md#81-capture-workflow-proto--app-server-parity]

### Agent Model Used

codex-5 (Developer Agent)

### Debug Log

- 2025-11-01T23:03Z — Planning AC#1/#2/#3 implementation: extend transcript generator to embed Codex CLI metadata and emit manifest, add error parity scenario plus streaming/tool-call regression coverage in parity + integration suites, refresh REQUIRED_TRANSCRIPTS and regenerate fixtures, then update parity docs and record test evidence after running `npm run transcripts:generate`, `npm run test:parity`, `npm run test:integration`, and `npm test`.
- 2025-11-01T23:18Z — Completed parity fixture updates, regenerated manifest, and captured regression evidence for parity/integration/E2E suites.

### Debug Log References

- 2025-11-01T23:12Z — Ran `npm run transcripts:generate` to refresh proto/app fixtures and emit transcript manifest with CLI metadata.
- 2025-11-01T23:13Z — Executed `npm run test:parity` verifying updated REQUIRED_TRANSCRIPTS list and manifest integrity.
- 2025-11-01T23:14Z — Executed `npx vitest run tests/integration --reporter=default --testTimeout=60000` to confirm app-server regression coverage.
- 2025-11-01T23:15Z — Executed `npx vitest run tests/integration/responses.stream.concurrency.int.test.js` to spot-check concurrency guard.
- 2025-11-01T23:16Z — Executed `npm test` (Playwright) to validate E2E SSE and chat parity flows against refreshed fixtures.

### Completion Notes

- AC #1: Extended parity harness (`tests/shared/transcript-utils.js`, `tests/parity/chat-fixture-parity.test.mjs`) with CLI-aware metadata checks, manifest validation, and new `nonstream-invalid-request.json` scenario recorded for proto/app backends.
- AC #2: Confirmed app-server execution path remains enabled across regression commands (`npm run test:parity`, `npx vitest run tests/integration --testTimeout=60000`, `npm test`) with targeted rerun of the streaming concurrency guard.
- AC #3: Documented refreshed workflow, manifest location, and CLI stamps in `docs/openai-endpoint-golden-parity.md` and migration runbook Section K; transcript generation now persists `test-results/chat-completions/manifest.json` with commit + version metadata.

## Senior Developer Review (AI)

- Reviewer: drj
- Date: 2025-11-01
- Outcome: Approve — Parity harness, documentation, and regression evidence satisfy all acceptance criteria with no outstanding risks.

### Summary

- Parity fixture generation now stamps CLI and node versions, emits a manifest for audit trails, and covers an explicit invalid-request scenario to exercise error envelopes across proto and app paths.
- Regression commands (`npm run transcripts:generate`, `npm run test:parity`, `npx vitest run tests/integration --testTimeout=60000`, `npm test`) were executed after fixture updates to confirm app-server behavior remains green.
- Parity runbooks and golden transcript documentation were refreshed to direct operators toward the new manifest and metadata requirements.

### Key Findings

- None — no blocking, medium, or low severity issues identified.

**Summary:** 8 of 8 completed tasks verified, 0 questionable, 0 falsely marked complete.

### Test Coverage and Gaps

- Verified commands executed after fixture refresh: `npm run transcripts:generate`, `npm run test:parity`, `npx vitest run tests/integration --reporter=default --testTimeout=60000`, targeted `npx vitest run tests/integration/responses.stream.concurrency.int.test.js`, and `npm test` (Playwright) (docs/stories/2-5-update-regression-suite-for-parity-evidence.md:116-120).
- Parity test now enforces CLI metadata and manifest integrity for every required transcript (tests/parity/chat-fixture-parity.test.mjs:45-83).
- No gaps observed; additional scenarios can be appended via the manifest without code changes.

### Architectural Alignment

- Changes align with the Epic 2 technical specification’s parity evidence requirements (docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md:1-160) and the architecture guidance to preserve deterministic transcripts and metadata for rollout sign-off (docs/architecture.md:1-208).

### Security Notes

- No new security considerations introduced; all additions operate on deterministic fixtures and documentation only.

### Best-Practices and References

- Follow the parity fixture workflow and manifest guidance in docs/openai-endpoint-golden-parity.md:315-326.
- Migration runbook Section K now captures CLI metadata expectations for parity evidence (docs/app-server-migration/codex-completions-api-migration.md:210-219).

### Action Items

**Code Changes Required:**

_None._

**Advisory Notes:**

- Note: Continue regenerating transcripts and manifest whenever fixtures change so parity checks stay authoritative.
