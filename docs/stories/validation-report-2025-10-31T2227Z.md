- Critical Issues: 0

## Section Results

### Expectation Group

Pass Rate: 5/6 (83.3%)

- ✓ PASS Previous Story Continuity — Still first executable story for Epic 2; sprint status shows predecessor in backlog, and the story notes no predecessor context.
- ✓ PASS Source Document Coverage — Story cites epics, PRD FR013, parity guide, migration runbook, architecture blueprint, transcript utilities, and Epic 2 test design.
- ✓ PASS Requirements Traceability — Acceptance Criteria match the epic entry and reference source docs.
- ✓ PASS Dev Notes Quality — Actionable guidance with canonical references (transcript utils, parity guide, doc updates).
- ✓ PASS Task ↔ AC Mapping — Tasks remain AC-tagged with dedicated testing subtasks.
- ✗ FAIL Structure — Section expects `Status: drafted`, but story is now `Status: ready-for-dev` after story-context workflow. Recommendation: when validating create-story output, run prior to generating story context; current state is acceptable for ready-for-dev.

## Failed Items

- **Structure** — Checklist assumes pre-context status. No action required if story is intentionally marked ready-for-dev.

## Partial Items

- None.

## Recommendations

1. Treat this validation as informational; the story is correctly advanced to ready-for-dev.
2. If re-running create-story validation is needed, execute it before story-context so the checklist expectations align.
