## Failed Items

_None_

## Partial Items

- ⚠ **Testing subtasks coverage** — Only a single testing subtask is defined for AC #2, leaving ACs #1/#3 without explicit test coverage tasks. Consider adding review/validation tasks or explaining why additional testing is not applicable. (docs/stories/2-6-document-parity-verification-and-rollout-checklist.md:27-33)

## Recommendations

1. **Must Fix:** None
2. **Should Improve:** Add explicit validation/test subtasks for ACs that require evidence, or document why supplemental testing is out of scope to clear the checklist warning.
3. **Consider:** Once the checklist document is drafted, populate Debug Log/Completion Notes entries with actual execution details to aid future validation.
