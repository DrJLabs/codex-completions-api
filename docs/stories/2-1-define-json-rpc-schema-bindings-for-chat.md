# Story 2.1: Define JSON-RPC Schema Bindings for Chat

Status: review

## Requirements Context Summary

- Tech spec designates `src/lib/json-rpc/schema.ts` as the home for Codex App Server method bindings (initialize, sendUserTurn, sendUserMessage, agentMessageDelta, agentMessage, tokenCount), making typed schemas a prerequisite for downstream adapters. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md#services-and-modules]
- PRD requirement FR003 mandates translating OpenAI-formatted payloads into official Codex JSON-RPC calls, so bindings must preserve those contract fields without invention. [Source: docs/PRD.md#functional-requirements]
- Architecture alignment maps Epic 2 scope to `src/lib/json-rpc*`, `src/handlers/chat`, and integration tests, reinforcing that shared schema definitions live in the library layer for reuse. [Source: docs/architecture.md#technology-stack-details]
- Parity fixture infrastructure from Story 2.0 supplies deterministic proto/app transcripts and sanitizers that the schema bindings should reference when crafting example payloads. [Source: docs/stories/2-0-establish-parity-verification-infrastructure.md#dev-notes]

## Project Structure Alignment

- Place generated or curated TypeScript definitions under `src/lib/json-rpc/` alongside the transport so handlers and tests import from a single module. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md#services-and-modules]
- Version-lock `@openai/codex@0.53.x` in `package.json` and document the regeneration workflow in the migration guide to keep schema artifacts consistent across environments. [Source: docs/app-server-migration/codex-completions-api-migration.md#a-replace-cli-invocation]
- House new unit tests in `tests/unit/json-rpc-schema.test.ts`, following the Epic 2 test design emphasis on parity-critical coverage. [Source: docs/test-design-epic-2.md#test-coverage-plan]

## Story

As a backend developer,
I want typed bindings between the proxy and Codex App Server schema,
so that request and response translation is type-safe and future updates are manageable.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. TypeScript bindings cover all chat-related JSON-RPC requests and notifications (initialize, sendUserTurn, sendUserMessage, agentMessageDelta, agentMessage, tokenCount) under `src/lib/json-rpc/schema.ts`, with exports ready for handler and transport consumers. [Source: docs/epics.md#story-21-define-json-rpc-schema-bindings-for-chat] [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md#services-and-modules]
2. The schema module records the CLI/schema version and provides a documented regeneration script or note tied to `@openai/codex@0.53.x`, ensuring future updates refresh types deterministically. [Source: docs/epics.md#story-21-define-json-rpc-schema-bindings-for-chat] [Source: docs/app-server-migration/codex-completions-api-migration.md#a-replace-cli-invocation]
3. Unit tests deserialize parity-fixture samples into the bindings and round-trip representative payloads, failing if signatures drift from Codex outputs. [Source: docs/epics.md#story-21-define-json-rpc-schema-bindings-for-chat] [Source: docs/test-design-epic-2.md#test-coverage-plan]

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] (AC #1) Implement `src/lib/json-rpc/schema.ts` with chat method and notification types sourced from Codex JSON-RPC payloads.
  - [x] (AC #1) Capture method parameter/response structures from CLI `codex app-server` schema output or parity transcripts; model discriminated unions for agentMessageDelta/agentMessage variants. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md#data-models-and-contracts]
  - [x] (AC #1 Testing) Run `npm run test:unit` to ensure types compile where referenced (CI will exercise via TypeScript build step if applicable). [Source: docs/test-design-epic-2.md#p0-critical---run-on-every-commit]
- [x] (AC #2) Pin and document schema regeneration workflow tied to `@openai/codex@0.53.x`.
  - [x] (AC #2) Add a developer script (e.g., `npm run jsonrpc:schema`) that captures the current schema version and regenerates `schema.ts` deterministically. [Source: docs/app-server-migration/codex-completions-api-migration.md#a-replace-cli-invocation]
  - [x] (AC #2) Update `docs/app-server-migration/codex-completions-api-migration.md` with refresh steps and CLI pinning notes, mirroring Story 2.0's parity documentation pattern. [Source: docs/stories/2-0-establish-parity-verification-infrastructure.md#change-log]
  - [x] (AC #2 Testing) Execute the script locally to confirm zero-diff regeneration when no upstream schema change exists.
- [x] (AC #3) Author `tests/unit/json-rpc-schema.test.ts` validating serialization/deserialization for baseline, tool-call, and error scenarios.
  - [x] (AC #3) Use parity fixtures captured in Story 2.0 (`test-results/chat-completions/{proto,app}`) to feed canonical payloads into the bindings. [Source: docs/stories/2-0-establish-parity-verification-infrastructure.md#dev-agent-record]
  - [x] (AC #3 Testing) Add the new test to the unit suite and ensure it runs under `npm run test:unit` and `npm run test:all`. [Source: docs/test-design-epic-2.md#p0-critical---run-on-every-commit]

### Review Follow-ups (AI)

- [x] [AI-Review][High] Restore exact pin of `@openai/codex` to 0.53.0 in dependencies and lockfile (AC #2). (Completed 2025-11-01)

## Dev Notes

- Import bindings into `src/services/transport/appServerClient.js` and chat handlers rather than duplicating JSON shape literals, keeping transport and adapters on the same type surface. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md#services-and-modules]
- Reuse sanitized transcripts from Story 2.0 to seed unit tests and sample fixtures; do not regenerate payloads unless the parity harness detects divergence. [Source: docs/stories/2-0-establish-parity-verification-infrastructure.md#dev-notes]
- When bumping the schema version, update `package.json` and regeneration docs atomically so the pinned `@openai/codex` release stays aligned with the recorded bindings. [Source: docs/app-server-migration/codex-completions-api-migration.md#a-replace-cli-invocation]

### Learnings from Previous Story

**From Story 2-0-establish-parity-verification-infrastructure (Status: done)**

- Parity diff harness (`tests/parity/chat-fixture-parity.test.mjs`) and sanitized transcript utilities are already in place—reuse these fixtures for schema validation rather than building new capture logic. [Source: docs/stories/2-0-establish-parity-verification-infrastructure.md#dev-agent-record]
- Documentation and runbooks were updated to include CLI version metadata; schema regeneration should append to the same guidance for a single source of truth. [Source: docs/stories/2-0-establish-parity-verification-infrastructure.md#change-log]
- New artifacts such as `docs/test-design-epic-2.md` describe risk-driven coverage expectations that this story’s tests must satisfy. [Source: docs/stories/2-0-establish-parity-verification-infrastructure.md#file-list]

### Project Structure Notes

- Keep JSON-RPC schema code in `src/lib/json-rpc/` to align with the architecture boundary for Epic 2 and avoid scattering type definitions across handlers. [Source: docs/architecture.md#technology-stack-details]
- Store unit tests under `tests/unit/` with naming `<module>.test.ts`, following the project pattern described in the architecture document. [Source: docs/architecture.md#implementation-patterns]
- Ensure any developer scripts live under `package.json` scripts and, if complex, within `scripts/jsonrpc/` to remain consistent with parity tooling conventions introduced in Story 2.0. [Source: docs/stories/2-0-establish-parity-verification-infrastructure.md#project-structure-alignment]

## Senior Developer Review (AI)

Reviewer: drj  
Date: 2025-11-01  
Outcome: Approve — schema bindings, regeneration tooling, and documentation updates satisfy all acceptance criteria with deterministic version control in place.

### Summary

- Schema bindings cover every chat JSON-RPC request and notification and expose pragmatic runtime guards (`src/lib/json-rpc/schema.ts:1`).
- Deterministic regeneration workflow captures the pinned Codex CLI version and ships a reproducible script plus documentation updates (`scripts/jsonrpc/render-schema.mjs:1`, `docs/app-server-migration/codex-completions-api-migration.md:34`).
- Fixture-backed unit tests exercise streaming, tool-call, and parity transcript scenarios and pass under `npm run test:unit` (`tests/unit/json-rpc-schema.test.ts:1`).

### Key Findings (by severity)

**HIGH**

- None.

**MEDIUM**

- None.

**LOW**

- The review confirms regeneration remains zero-diff under the pinned CLI version; continue monitoring when bumping Codex releases.

Summary: 10 of 10 task items verified.

### Test Coverage and Gaps

- `npm run test:unit` (2025-11-01 00:02Z) exercises the new schema validation suite, including streaming and tool-call scenarios.
- No additional integration or e2e gaps identified for this story scope.

### Architectural Alignment

- Bindings reside under `src/lib/json-rpc/` per Epic 2 structure, feeding transport and handler layers without duplicating schemas (`src/lib/json-rpc/schema.ts:1`).
- Regeneration guidance in the migration doc keeps operations aligned with the Codex rollout process (`docs/app-server-migration/codex-completions-api-migration.md:34`).

### Security Notes

- No security-impacting changes observed; schema and tooling operate within existing boundaries.

### Best-Practices and References

- Documentation refreshed to include deterministic regeneration workflow (`docs/app-server-migration/codex-completions-api-migration.md:34`).
- Scripted generation draws version metadata directly from the pinned dependency, making CLI bumps auditable (`scripts/jsonrpc/render-schema.mjs:1`).

### Action Items

**Code Changes Required:**

- None.

**Advisory Notes:**

- Note: When bumping `@openai/codex`, rerun `npm run jsonrpc:schema` and update the story change log to capture the new CLI version.

## Senior Developer Review (AI)

Reviewer: drj  
Date: 2025-11-01  
Outcome: Changes Requested — dependency pinning no longer satisfies the strict version-lock requirement (AC #2).

### Summary

- Schema module exports and runtime guards align with the Epic 2 data-model contract (`src/lib/json-rpc/schema.ts:1-229`).
- New Vitest coverage exercises streaming text, tool-call deltas, and parity fixtures, preventing silent drift in binding contracts (`tests/unit/json-rpc-schema.test.ts:1-219`).
- Dependency pinning regressed to a caret range, so the Codex CLI is no longer strictly locked to 0.53.0 (`package.json:60`).

### Key Findings

**HIGH**

- Caret range on `@openai/codex` allows unreviewed CLI upgrades, breaking the story requirement to pin the schema source (`package.json:60`, `package-lock.json:12`).

**MEDIUM**

- None.

**LOW**

- Documentation and tooling updates look consistent; no additional low-severity observations.

Summary: 10 of 11 task items verified; 1 task (AC #2 pinning) requires remediation.

### Test Coverage and Gaps

- Vitest suite now covers streaming text, tool-call delta handling, and parity transcript projections for JSON-RPC bindings (`tests/unit/json-rpc-schema.test.ts:1-219`).
- No integration or e2e regressions expected for this story layer; existing parity tests remain untouched.

### Architectural Alignment

- Binding placement under `src/lib/json-rpc/` follows the Epic 2 architecture guidelines (`docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md`).
- Deterministic regeneration script integrates with the documented codex migration workflow (`docs/app-server-migration/codex-completions-api-migration.md:34`).

### Security Notes

- No security-impacting changes observed.

### Best-Practices and References

- Reference: docs/app-server-migration/codex-completions-api-migration.md:34 (added regeneration guidance).
- Reference: scripts/jsonrpc/render-schema.mjs:1-119 (deterministic schema generation pipeline).

### Action Items

**Code Changes Required:**

- [ ] [High] Reinstate exact pin of `@openai/codex` to 0.53.0 in dependencies (AC #2) [file: package.json:60]
- [ ] [High] Update root lockfile entry to match the fixed Codex CLI version 0.53.0 (AC #2) [file: package-lock.json:12]

**Advisory Notes:**

- Note: Once dependency pinning is restored, re-run `npm run jsonrpc:schema` to confirm deterministic output and update the change log accordingly.
