✓ PASS Acceptance criteria mirror the draft wording exactly, including exponential backoff language. Evidence: docs/stories/1-3-implement-worker-supervisor-and-lifecycle-hooks.context.xml:22-26 compared to docs/stories/1-3-implement-worker-supervisor-and-lifecycle-hooks.md:19-27.
✓ PASS Tasks section enumerates every AC with implementation/testing subtasks. Evidence: docs/stories/1-3-implement-worker-supervisor-and-lifecycle-hooks.context.xml:16-21.

### Documentation Artifacts

Pass Rate: 2/2 (100%)

✓ PASS 10 relevant documents captured with project-relative paths and summaries spanning epics, PRD, architecture, migration, and prior story learnings. Evidence: docs/stories/1-3-implement-worker-supervisor-and-lifecycle-hooks.context.xml:30-39.
✓ PASS No missing required sources (tech spec/unified project structure absent in repo, noted during assembly). Evidence: repository search for `tech-spec-epic-1` and `unified-project-structure.md` returned none.

### Code & Interfaces

Pass Rate: 3/3 (100%)

✓ PASS Code section lists supervisor touchpoints (codex-runner, backend-mode, server bootstrap, health route, concurrency guard, tests). Evidence: docs/stories/1-3-implement-worker-supervisor-and-lifecycle-hooks.context.xml:40-47.
✓ PASS Interfaces section describes supervisor integrations with codex-runner, server signals, health endpoints, config, and telemetry. Evidence: docs/stories/1-3-implement-worker-supervisor-and-lifecycle-hooks.context.xml:55-60.
✓ PASS Constraints outline deployment, logging, feature flag, and PRD timing rules. Evidence: docs/stories/1-3-implement-worker-supervisor-and-lifecycle-hooks.context.xml:48-54.

### Dependencies & Testing

Pass Rate: 2/2 (100%)

✓ PASS Dependencies capture runtime packages, base image, and tooling relevant to supervisor work. Evidence: docs/stories/1-3-implement-worker-supervisor-and-lifecycle-hooks.context.xml:44-47.
✓ PASS Testing standards, locations, and ideas populated with actionable coverage plans tied to ACs. Evidence: docs/stories/1-3-implement-worker-supervisor-and-lifecycle-hooks.context.xml:62-69.

### Structure & Format

Pass Rate: 0/0 (N/A)

✓ PASS XML structure conforms to template: metadata, story, acceptanceCriteria, artifacts, constraints, interfaces, tests blocks all present and well-formed. Evidence: xmllint-style inspection (visual review of file).

## Failed Items

None.

## Recommendations

1. Must Fix: None.
2. Should Improve: None.
3. Consider: When JSON-RPC transport work begins, add references to the new transport module so future stories inherit the context automatically.
