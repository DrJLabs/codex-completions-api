**Date:** 2025-11-01T21:14:24Z

## Summary

- Overall: 17/26 passed (65%)
- Critical Issues: 3

## Section Results

### 1. Load Story and Extract Metadata

Pass Rate: 4/4 (100%)

- ✓ Story parsed and metadata extracted (lines 1-61).

### 2. Previous Story Continuity

Pass Rate: 3/7 (43%)

- ✓ Located predecessor `2-3-implement-streaming-response-adapter` (docs/sprint-status.yaml:50).
- ✓ Prior story contents reviewed for completion notes and file list (docs/stories/2-3-implement-streaming-response-adapter.md:90-123).
- ✗ Learnings from previous story subsection missing in current Dev Notes — no handoff guidance present (docs/stories/2-4-align-error-handling-and-retries.md:26-35). **Critical**
- ✗ No references to previous story new files or completion warnings due to missing subsection. **Major**
- ✗ No citation back to previous story document `[Source: stories/2-3-implement-streaming-response-adapter.md]`. **Major**

### 3. Source Document Coverage

Pass Rate: 3/6 (50%)

- ✓ Tech spec cited in Dev Notes (docs/stories/2-4-align-error-handling-and-retries.md:28).
- ✗ Epics document exists but is only listed in references, not cited in Dev Notes (lines 39-45 vs. 26-35). **Critical**
- ✗ PRD document exists but is only listed in references, not cited in Dev Notes (lines 39-45 vs. 26-35). **Critical**
- ✗ architecture.md exists yet no Dev Notes guidance references it (docs/architecture.md; Dev Notes lines 26-30). **Major**
- ✓ Project Structure Notes subsection present (lines 32-35).
- ✓ Citations that are present resolve to real files (spot-checked tech spec and migration doc).

### 4. Acceptance Criteria Quality

Pass Rate: 3/3 (100%)

- ✓ Three ACs captured with explicit sources (lines 13-15).
- ✓ ACs map to Epic 2 Story 2.4 scope (docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md:74-78; docs/epics.md:219-229).
- ✓ No conflicting or missing AC coverage detected.

### 5. Dev Notes and Task Quality

Pass Rate: 2/3 (67%)

- ✓ Dev Notes provide implementation guidance tied to concrete modules (lines 26-30).
- ✗ Task list lacks explicit testing subtasks for AC #1/#2 (lines 19-24) → testing coverage incomplete. **Major**
- ✓ Tasks explicitly reference their corresponding AC ids (lines 19-24).

### 6. Structure & Completeness

Pass Rate: 2/4 (50%)

- ✓ Status set to `drafted` (line 3).
- ✓ Story statement follows required format (lines 7-9).
- ⚠ Dev Agent Record present but completely empty (lines 47-61) — needs baseline notes before handoff.
- ✗ Change Log section missing entirely; expected per story template. **Major**

## Failed Items

- Missing “Learnings from Previous Story” section with actionable carry-over guidance. (Critical)
- Dev Notes omit citations to epics.md and PRD.md despite availability. (Critical)
- Dev Notes lack architecture.md citation even though architectural constraints apply. (Major)
- Task list lacks explicit testing subtasks ensuring regression coverage for AC #1/#2. (Major)
- Story skeleton omits Change Log section required by template. (Major)

## Partial Items

- Dev Agent Record present but empty; populate with context and future handoff notes before marking ready.

## Recommendations

1. Must Fix: Add a “Learnings from Previous Story” subsection summarizing completion notes/new files from Story 2.3 and cite `stories/2-3-implement-streaming-response-adapter.md`. Include architecture/epics/PRD citations in Dev Notes. Restore Change Log section. Add explicit testing subtasks for AC #1/#2 covering error-parity regression scenarios.
2. Should Improve: Populate Dev Agent Record with planned tooling, metrics hooks, and dependencies so developers can start execution without hunting context.
3. Consider: Reference maintenance flag/rollback runbook material (if applicable) to guide operator-focused testing once error mappings ship.
