## Section Results

- Story fields capture the user story verbatim. Evidence: docs/stories/1-3-implement-worker-supervisor-and-lifecycle-hooks.context.xml:12-21.
- Acceptance criteria match the drafted story exactly. Evidence: docs/stories/1-3-implement-worker-supervisor-and-lifecycle-hooks.context.xml:29-31 vs docs/stories/1-3-implement-worker-supervisor-and-lifecycle-hooks.md:23-27.
- Tasks mirror the story subtasks and include testing hooks per AC. Evidence: docs/stories/1-3-implement-worker-supervisor-and-lifecycle-hooks.context.xml:16-26.
- Docs section lists 10 relevant references spanning epics, PRD, architecture, migration, and prior story learnings. Evidence: docs/stories/1-3-implement-worker-supervisor-and-lifecycle-hooks.context.xml:34-43.
- Code artifacts enumerate the modules/tests that require updates for supervisor lifecycle management. Evidence: docs/stories/1-3-implement-worker-supervisor-and-lifecycle-hooks.context.xml:44-51.
- Dependencies capture runtime packages, base image, and tooling pertinent to the story. Evidence: docs/stories/1-3-implement-worker-supervisor-and-lifecycle-hooks.context.xml:52-55.
