### Interfaces extracted

### Constraints listed

PASS — count=5

### Dependencies captured

PASS — node:

### Testing standards

PASS — Vitest covers unit and integration flows; use `npm run test:integration` for health/supervisor suites and keep Playwright SSE runs in the pipeline for regression confidence. Smoke scripts (`npm run smoke:dev`) hit `/healthz` before broader checks.

### Testing locations

PASS — tests/integration/routes.health.int.test.js, tests/integration/worker-supervisor.int.test.js, tests/integration/backend-mode.int.test.js

### Testing ideas

PASS — - AC1: Simulate failed handshake by stubbing supervisor readiness false and assert `/healthz` readiness stays false and logs reason.

### XML structure

PASS — Root tags present

## Failed Items

- Major Acceptance criteria parity: Story AC vs context AC comparison

## Recommendations

1. Major: Story AC vs context AC comparison
2. Major: Story tasks vs context tasks
