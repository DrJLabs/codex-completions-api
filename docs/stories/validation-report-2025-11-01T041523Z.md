## Summary

- Overall: 6/6 passed (100%)
- Critical Issues: 0

## Section Results

### Previous Story Continuity

Pass Rate: 4/4 (100%)

✓ Verified sprint ordering: `docs/sprint-status.yaml:49` lists Story 2-2 after 2-1 (status `done`).
✓ Learnings subsection present with explicit reuse guidance and citation to the prior story (`docs/stories/2-2-implement-request-translation-layer.md:50-54`).
✓ Previous story’s open action items captured (dependency pin + lockfile) and reiterated as high-priority follow-up (`docs/stories/2-2-implement-request-translation-layer.md:53`; original items at `docs/stories/2-1-define-json-rpc-schema-bindings-for-chat.md:248-249`).
✓ New artifacts from Story 2-1 (schema bindings, fixture suite) referenced for reuse (`docs/stories/2-2-implement-request-translation-layer.md:52-54`).

### Source Document Coverage

Pass Rate: 5/5 (100%)

✓ Tech spec cited for services/modules, performance, observability, and sequencing (`docs/stories/2-2-implement-request-translation-layer.md:7-11,45-48,63-69`).
✓ Epics and PRD cited for AC provenance (`docs/stories/2-2-implement-request-translation-layer.md:8,28-30`).
✓ Architecture and migration guides referenced for structure and workflow alignment (`docs/stories/2-2-implement-request-translation-layer.md:15-18,45-48,56-59`).
✓ Confirmed auxiliary docs such as `testing-strategy.md`, `coding-standards.md`, and `unified-project-structure.md` do not exist in `docs/`, so no missing citations (checked via directory listing).
✓ All citations use accessible paths; no broken references detected.

### Acceptance Criteria Quality

Pass Rate: 3/3 (100%)

✓ Three ACs captured, each tied to tech spec and epic sources (`docs/stories/2-2-implement-request-translation-layer.md:28-30`).
✓ AC content mirrors Epic 2 Story 2.2 requirements (see `docs/epics.md:46-60`).
✓ No invented or unsupported acceptance criteria identified.

### Tasks & Testing Mapping

Pass Rate: 3/3 (100%)

✓ Task list covers every AC with explicit `(AC #n)` references (`docs/stories/2-2-implement-request-translation-layer.md:34-41`).
✓ Testing subtasks captured (`Run npm run test:integration`) ensuring parity evidence (`docs/stories/2-2-implement-request-translation-layer.md:39-41`).
✓ Negative-case coverage called out for validation pathways (`docs/stories/2-2-implement-request-translation-layer.md:37-38`).

### Structure & Metadata

Pass Rate: 3/3 (100%)

✓ Status marked `drafted` and story statement present (`docs/stories/2-2-implement-request-translation-layer.md:3,22-24`).
✓ Dev Agent Record scaffold populated with model placeholder (`docs/stories/2-2-implement-request-translation-layer.md:75-88`).
✓ Change log initialized (`docs/stories/2-2-implement-request-translation-layer.md:90-92`).

### Unresolved Review Alerts

Pass Rate: 1/1 (100%)

✓ Outstanding review tasks from Story 2-1 identified and reiterated for follow-up (`docs/stories/2-2-implement-request-translation-layer.md:53`; source items at `docs/stories/2-1-define-json-rpc-schema-bindings-for-chat.md:248-249`).

## Failed Items

None.

## Partial Items

None.

## Recommendations

1. Must Fix: None.
2. Should Improve: When implementation lands, update the change log with executed commands and validation evidence.
3. Consider: Highlight deterministic transcript sources by name (e.g., `tests/unit/json-rpc-schema.test.ts`) in Dev Notes for quicker reference.
