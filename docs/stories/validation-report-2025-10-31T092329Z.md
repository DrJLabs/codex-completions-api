## Section Results

### Previous Story Continuity

Pass Rate: 4/4 (100%)

✓ PASS `Learnings from Previous Story` enumerates Story 1.2’s new assets, health checks, and confirms no outstanding follow-ups. Evidence: docs/stories/1-3-implement-worker-supervisor-and-lifecycle-hooks.md:48-52.
✓ PASS Story cites the predecessor for reuse guidance. Evidence: docs/stories/1-3-implement-worker-supervisor-and-lifecycle-hooks.md:48-52 (links to docs/stories/1-2-package-codex-cli-with-app-server-capability.md#completion-notes-list).
✓ PASS Prior story’s Dev Agent record lists new files/services to reuse. Evidence: docs/stories/1-2-package-codex-cli-with-app-server-capability.md:40-110.
✓ PASS No unchecked review items found in Story 1.2, so none needed in Learnings. Evidence: docs/stories/1-2-package-codex-cli-with-app-server-capability.md (no `[ ]` entries).
