## Section Results

### Expectation Group

Pass Rate: 6/6 (100.0%)

- ✓ PASS Previous Story Continuity — Sprint status shows preceding entry `2-1-define-json-rpc-schema-bindings-for-chat` in backlog; as the first implemented story in Epic 2, continuity is not required and the story explicitly notes the absence of predecessor context.
- ✓ PASS Source Document Coverage — Story cites epics (`docs/epics.md`), PRD FR013, the parity reference guide (`docs/openai-endpoint-golden-parity.md`), migration runbook (`docs/app-server-migration/codex-completions-api-migration.md`), transcript utilities, and now the architecture blueprint (`docs/architecture.md#epic-2--v1chatcompletions-json-rpc-parity`).
- ✓ PASS Requirements Traceability — Acceptance Criteria directly reference epic entry and parity guide; tasks map to ACs.
- ✓ PASS Dev Notes Quality — Guidance references reusable helpers and documents where to update runbooks, giving implementers concrete direction.
- ✓ PASS Task ↔ AC Mapping — Every task is tagged with its AC number and includes explicit testing subtasks.
- ✓ PASS Structure — Story retains template sections (`Dev Agent Record`, `Change Log`) with placeholders for future updates and the status remains `drafted`.

## Failed Items

- None.

## Partial Items

- None.

## Recommendations

1. Maintain the new architecture citation and placeholders when generating Story Context.
2. Attach future implementation artefacts (debug logs, file lists) to the `Dev Agent Record` once development completes.
