# Story 2.6: Document Parity Verification and Rollout Checklist

Status: done

## Requirements Context Summary

- Epic 2 assigns this story to consolidate parity verification documentation and rollout approvals before switching production traffic to the Codex App Server. [Source: docs/epics.md#story-26-document-parity-verification-and-rollout-checklist]
- The technical specification mandates deterministic parity fixtures, enforced quality gates, and evidence-driven rollout governance; the checklist must reflect those requirements. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md#test-strategy-summary]
- PRD functional requirements FR013–FR015 require refreshed regression coverage, smoke automation, and operational runbooks captured as audit-ready collateral. [Source: docs/PRD.md#functional-requirements]
- The migration runbook prescribes the parity fixture maintenance workflow and environment verification steps that the checklist must encode. [Source: docs/app-server-migration/codex-completions-api-migration.md#k-parity-fixture-maintenance-workflow]
- Epic 2 test design establishes parity quality gates (P0 suites, checklist enforcement); the review plan must demonstrate compliance. [Source: docs/test-design-epic-2.md#quality-gate-criteria]

## Story

As a program manager,
I want a comprehensive parity verification checklist with captured rollout evidence,
so that stakeholders can approve switching `/v1/chat/completions` traffic to the Codex App Server with confidence.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The documented parity verification checklist enumerates required regression suites, parity harness commands, manual validation steps, and rollout metrics needed before enabling the Codex App Server flag. [Source: docs/epics.md#story-26-document-parity-verification-and-rollout-checklist] [Source: docs/test-design-epic-2.md#quality-gate-criteria] [Source: docs/app-server-migration/codex-completions-api-migration.md#n-runbook-checklist-updates]
2. An audit-ready evidence package is published under `docs/app-server-migration/`, including summary tables that capture parity run results, CLI metadata from `test-results/chat-completions/manifest.json`, refreshed transcripts, and links to regression outputs. [Source: docs/epics.md#story-26-document-parity-verification-and-rollout-checklist] [Source: docs/app-server-migration/codex-completions-api-migration.md#k-parity-fixture-maintenance-workflow] [Source: docs/test-design-epic-2.md#test-coverage-plan]
3. QA, SRE, and Product stakeholders have a scheduled and documented review plan with sign-off checkpoints, meeting logistics, and follow-up actions captured in the checklist. [Source: docs/epics.md#story-26-document-parity-verification-and-rollout-checklist] [Source: docs/PRD.md#goals-and-background-context] [Source: docs/test-design-epic-2.md#quality-gate-criteria]

- [x] (AC #2) Update `docs/sprint-status.yaml` to mark this story as drafted once the documentation package is in place. [Source: docs/sprint-status.yaml]

## Dev Notes

- Checklist output should stay tightly grounded in authoritative docs—quote acceptance criteria verbatim where possible and embed citations for every verification step to simplify validation. [Source: docs/epics.md#story-26-document-parity-verification-and-rollout-checklist]
- Capture operational readiness signals (probes, smoke scripts, metrics) so reviewers can trace each sign-off back to documented evidence. [Source: docs/app-server-migration/codex-completions-api-migration.md#n-runbook-checklist-updates] [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md#test-strategy-summary]

### Learnings from Previous Story

- Reuse the parity harness, transcript generator, and manifest introduced in Story 2.5—do not fork tooling or duplicate evidence repositories. [Source: stories/2-5-update-regression-suite-for-parity-evidence.md#dev-notes]
- Story 2.5’s review closed without pending items, but it emphasized maintaining CLI metadata and parity manifest integrity; incorporate those details as required checklist artifacts. [Source: stories/2-5-update-regression-suite-for-parity-evidence.md#completion-notes]

### Architecture Patterns and Constraints

- Keep rollout documentation consistent with the architecture decision record on feature flag management and health gating so operations teams can map checklist steps to live systems. [Source: docs/architecture.md#decision-summary]
- Highlight mandatory environment expectations (writable `.codex-api/`, readiness probes, Traefik health checks) when describing rollout prerequisites. [Source: docs/app-server-migration/codex-completions-api-migration.md#n-runbook-checklist-updates]

### Testing Expectations

- Re-run parity regeneration commands and regression suites immediately before documenting evidence; attach command outputs or CI references to the evidence tables. [Source: docs/app-server-migration/codex-completions-api-migration.md#k-parity-fixture-maintenance-workflow]
- Align checklist verification steps with the P0/P1 test coverage expectations from the Epic 2 test design to ensure nothing critical is omitted. [Source: docs/test-design-epic-2.md#test-coverage-plan]

### Project Structure Notes

- Previous story 2-5 shipped refreshed parity harness outputs (`test-results/chat-completions/**`, manifest, updated docs) and closed the review with no outstanding findings—reuse those assets and cite the story for evidence continuity. [Source: stories/2-5-update-regression-suite-for-parity-evidence.md#file-list] [Source: stories/2-5-update-regression-suite-for-parity-evidence.md#senior-developer-review-ai]
- The checklist and evidence tables belong alongside the existing migration materials under `docs/app-server-migration/`; keep parity workflow steps aligned with that runbook. [Source: docs/app-server-migration/codex-completions-api-migration.md#k-parity-fixture-maintenance-workflow]
- Reference the canonical parity spec for transcript handling and tooling expectations when documenting required evidence. [Source: docs/openai-endpoint-golden-parity.md#81-capture-workflow-proto--app-server-parity]
- Story work stays within documentation and planning artifacts—no source tree changes expected; follow repo structure conventions when linking paths. [Source: docs/bmad/architecture/source-tree.md#overview]

### Test Coverage and Gaps

- `npm run transcripts:generate` — refreshed proto/app captures and manifest metadata (docs/app-server-migration/parity-rollout-checklist.md:46).
- `npm run test:parity` — parity harness passed all 14 tests (docs/app-server-migration/parity-rollout-checklist.md:47).
- `npm run test:integration` — integration suites covering JSON-RPC adapters and metadata sanitization passed (docs/app-server-migration/parity-rollout-checklist.md:48).
- `npm test` — Playwright SSE/API end-to-end coverage passed (docs/app-server-migration/parity-rollout-checklist.md:49).
- `npm run smoke:dev` — dev environment smoke validation succeeded (docs/app-server-migration/parity-rollout-checklist.md:52).
- `npm run lint:runbooks` — runbook formatting verified (docs/stories/2-6-document-parity-verification-and-rollout-checklist.md:92).

### Architectural Alignment

- Checklist reiterates readiness probe expectations, writable `.codex-api/`, and smoke validation workflow consistent with architecture decisions (docs/app-server-migration/parity-rollout-checklist.md:22; docs/architecture.md:18).
- Evidence references parity harness and regression gating prescribed in Epic 2 technical specification (docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md:133).

### Security Notes

- No new security risks identified; documentation preserves bearer auth requirements and writable state constraints (docs/architecture.md:18).

### Best-Practices and References

- Epic 2 technical specification — parity gating and test coverage expectations (docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md:133).
- Architecture decision log — readiness gating, `.codex-api/` handling, and Traefik requirements (docs/architecture.md:18).
- Migration runbook section N — rollout checklist context and smoke expectations (docs/app-server-migration/codex-completions-api-migration.md:253).

### Action Items

**Code Changes Required:**

- None.

**Advisory Notes:**

- Note: Archive smoke curl transcripts under `./artifacts/smoke/{env}/` before stakeholder review per checklist follow-up (docs/app-server-migration/parity-rollout-checklist.md:85).
