## Summary
- Overall: 8/8 sections passed (100%)
- Critical Issues: 0

## Section Results

### 1. Load Story & Metadata
Pass Rate: 4/4 (100%)
- ✓ Story file includes Status, Story, ACs, Tasks, Dev Notes, Dev Agent Record, and Change Log (docs/stories/2-8-implement-tool-call-aggregator.md:1-154).

### 2. Previous Story Continuity
Pass Rate: 5/5 (100%)
- ✓ `Learnings from Previous Story` subsection now summarizes schema bundle/files created during Story 2.7 and cites completion notes + file lineage. [Docs: docs/stories/2-8-implement-tool-call-aggregator.md:96-100 referencing stories/2-7-align-json-rpc-wiring-with-app-server-schema.md#dev-agent-record]
- ✓ Confirms no unresolved review items from Story 2.7, satisfying checklist expectations.

### 3. Source Document Coverage
Pass Rate: 5/5 (100%)
- ✓ Dev Notes reference PRD, epics, tool-call brief, architecture.md, tech-spec, and coding standards in both context bullets and the References list (docs/stories/2-8-implement-tool-call-aggregator.md:82-129).

### 4. Acceptance Criteria Quality
Pass Rate: 4/4 (100%)
- ✓ Eleven ACs remain specific, testable, and cite their original sources (docs/stories/2-8-implement-tool-call-aggregator.md:13-23).

### 5. Task–AC Mapping & Testing Coverage
Pass Rate: 4/4 (100%)
- ✓ The new "Acceptance criteria validation matrix" provides per-AC testing subtasks (11 items) referencing the relevant specs/tests, ensuring testing subtasks ≥ AC count (docs/stories/2-8-implement-tool-call-aggregator.md:67-78).

### 6. Dev Notes Quality
Pass Rate: 4/4 (100%)
- ✓ Dev Notes now include the continuity subsection plus explicit references to the Epic 2 tech spec and coding standards as required (docs/stories/2-8-implement-tool-call-aggregator.md:82-115).

### 7. Story Structure
Pass Rate: 4/4 (100%)
- ✓ Status remains “drafted,” story statement keeps the correct format, Dev Agent Record scaffolding exists, and Change Log initialized (docs/stories/2-8-implement-tool-call-aggregator.md:1-154).

### 8. Unresolved Review Items
Pass Rate: 2/2 (100%)
- ✓ Previous story shows no unchecked review boxes, and the new Learnings section documents that no follow-ups remain (stories/2-7-align-json-rpc-wiring-with-app-server-schema.md:101-119; docs/stories/2-8-implement-tool-call-aggregator.md:96-100).
