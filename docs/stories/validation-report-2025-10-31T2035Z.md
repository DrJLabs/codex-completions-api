## Section Results

### Expectation Group

Pass Rate: 4/6 (66.7%)

- ✓ PASS Previous Story Continuity — Sprint status shows preceding entry `2-4-align-error-handling-and-retries` with status `backlog`; no implementation context exists, and the story explicitly notes it is first for Epic 2. Evidence: docs/sprint-status.yaml, docs/stories/2-0-establish-parity-verification-infrastructure.md ("First story for Epic 2 — no predecessor").
- ✗ FAIL Source Document Coverage — Architecture guideline exists (`docs/architecture.md`, e.g., lines 5-105 covering JSON-RPC transport expectations) but the story lacks a corresponding citation in Requirements Context or Dev Notes. Impact: downstream stories lose architectural traceability, risking divergence from the documented JSON-RPC transport design.
- ✓ PASS Requirements Traceability — Acceptance Criteria reference the epic entry and parity guide explicitly ([Source: docs/epics.md#story-20...], [Source: docs/openai-endpoint-golden-parity.md...]).
- ✓ PASS Dev Notes Quality — Notes provide actionable guidance (reuse transcript utils, align scenario coverage) with citations to docs/openai-endpoint-golden-parity.md and tests/shared/transcript-utils.js.
- ✓ PASS Task ↔ AC Mapping — Every top-level task references its AC (e.g., `(AC #1)`, `(AC #2)`), including explicit testing subtasks.
- ✗ FAIL Structure Completeness — Story is missing required `## Dev Agent Record` and `## Change Log` sections that the create-story template expects, leaving no placeholders for implementation artifacts and review notes.

## Failed Items

1. **Source Document Coverage** — Add explicit citation(s) to `docs/architecture.md` (and any other relevant architecture artifacts) within Requirements Context Summary or Dev Notes, mapping story scope back to the documented JSON-RPC transport design.
2. **Structure Completeness** — Restore template sections (`## Dev Agent Record` with subheadings, `## Change Log`) so future implementation work has the standard placeholders for notes, file lists, and review history.

## Partial Items

- None.

## Recommendations

1. **Must Fix:** Cite `docs/architecture.md` within the story, clarifying how parity fixtures align with the documented transport architecture.
2. **Must Fix:** Reintroduce the template’s `Dev Agent Record` and `Change Log` sections (with standard subheadings) to maintain consistent implementation records for Epic 2.
3. **Consider:** After adding the above, re-run `validate-create-story` to confirm full compliance.
