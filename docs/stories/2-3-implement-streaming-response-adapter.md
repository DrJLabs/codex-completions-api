# Story 2.3: Implement Streaming Response Adapter

Status: done

## Requirements Context Summary

- Streaming adapter must convert Codex JSON-RPC notifications into the existing SSE contract so clients see identical delta ordering, finish reasons, and tool payloads. [Source: docs/epics.md#story-23-implement-streaming-response-adapter]
- Parity requirements FR001–FR004 keep the `/v1/chat/completions` surface, streaming shapes, and error semantics unchanged while we migrate to the app-server backend. [Source: docs/PRD.md#functional-requirements]
- Tech spec directs Story 2.3 to wire transport notifications through `handleStreamingResponse` with deterministic `[DONE]` emission and latency telemetry. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md#apis-and-interfaces] [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md#workflows-and-sequencing]
- Migration runbook codifies how `agentMessageDelta`, `agentMessage`, and `tokenCount` notifications map to SSE chunks, usage accounting, and cleanup, highlighting concurrency safety requirements. [Source: docs/app-server-migration/codex-completions-api-migration.md#d-streaming-path-sse] [Source: docs/app-server-migration/codex-completions-api-migration.md#c2-reader-responses--notifications]
- Architecture map anchors the SSE gateway in `src/handlers/chat/stream.js` and mandates role-first deltas plus `[DONE]` while reusing existing transport and metrics pipelines. [Source: docs/architecture.md#integration-points] [Source: docs/architecture.md#implementation-patterns]
- Streaming delta parity sits in the P0 test plan, requiring golden transcript comparisons and token/latency verification before regression gates pass. [Source: docs/test-design-epic-2.md#test-coverage-plan]

## Project Structure Alignment

- Extend the existing SSE gateway in `src/handlers/chat/stream.js` to branch on `BACKEND_APP_SERVER`, reusing `handleStreamingResponse` to emit role-first deltas and `[DONE]` while honoring current guard middleware. [Source: docs/architecture.md#integration-points]
- Reuse the transport adapter introduced in Story 2.2—`createJsonRpcChildAdapter` and `appServerClient`—to subscribe to `agentMessageDelta`, `agentMessage`, and `tokenCount` notifications without reimplementing request normalization. [Source: docs/stories/2-2-implement-request-translation-layer.md#project-structure-notes] [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md#apis-and-interfaces]
- Feed streaming payloads through `normalizeChatJsonRpcRequest`’s outputs so transport context (conversation ids, include_usage flags) stays synchronized and avoids duplicate bookkeeping. [Source: docs/stories/2-2-implement-request-translation-layer.md#dev-notes]
- Capture first-token and total latency using the existing metrics/logging pipeline (`src/services/metrics` + structured logs) to satisfy NFR002 and observability mandates. [Source: docs/architecture.md#implementation-patterns] [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md#performance] [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md#observability]
- Persist parity evidence by extending `tests/integration/chat-jsonrpc.int.test.js` and the golden transcript harness under `docs/app-server-migration/parity-fixtures/`, aligning with the Epic 2 P0 streaming delta test. [Source: docs/test-design-epic-2.md#test-coverage-plan] [Source: docs/app-server-migration/codex-completions-api-migration.md#d-streaming-path-sse]

## Story

As an application developer,
I want JSON-RPC streaming events converted back into SSE deltas,
so that clients observe identical role/token sequencing.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Streaming adapter consumes `agentMessageDelta`, `agentMessage`, and `tokenCount` notifications from the JSON-RPC transport and emits OpenAI-compatible SSE deltas, tool-call blocks, and terminal `[DONE]` events without altering existing payload shapes. [Source: docs/epics.md#story-23-implement-streaming-response-adapter] [Source: docs/app-server-migration/codex-completions-api-migration.md#d-streaming-path-sse] [Source: docs/PRD.md#functional-requirements]
2. Adapter records per-request first-token and total latency, propagates usage totals, and logs structured telemetry consistent with current observability patterns before closing the stream. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md#performance] [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md#observability] [Source: docs/architecture.md#implementation-patterns]
3. Deterministic parity evidence covers streaming scenarios: golden transcript diff passes for baseline + tool-call flows, and integration tests fail if delta ordering or finish reasons diverge. [Source: docs/test-design-epic-2.md#test-coverage-plan] [Source: docs/openai-endpoint-golden-parity.md#streaming-transcript-matrix]

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] (AC #1) Implement JSON-RPC streaming adapter in `src/handlers/chat/stream.js`, subscribing to `agentMessageDelta`, `agentMessage`, and `tokenCount` notifications and emitting matching SSE chunks plus `[DONE]`. [Source: docs/epics.md#story-23-implement-streaming-response-adapter] [Source: docs/app-server-migration/codex-completions-api-migration.md#d-streaming-path-sse]
  - [x] (AC #1) Integrate transport hooks via `createJsonRpcChildAdapter`/`appServerClient` so streaming context reuses Story 2.2 normalization outputs without duplicating request bookkeeping. [Source: docs/stories/2-2-implement-request-translation-layer.md#project-structure-notes] [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md#apis-and-interfaces]
  - [x] (AC #1) Handle tool-call payloads and usage accumulation while respecting concurrency guard and disconnect semantics already enforced by the SSE gateway. [Source: docs/app-server-migration/codex-completions-api-migration.md#c2-reader-responses--notifications] [Source: docs/architecture.md#integration-points]
- [x] (AC #2) Record first-token and total stream latency plus usage metrics, emitting structured logs and Prometheus updates before closing responses. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md#performance] [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md#observability]
  - [x] (AC #2) Ensure aggregated usage surfaces in final SSE `[DONE]` and non-stream fallback paths consistent with FR002/FR004. [Source: docs/PRD.md#functional-requirements]
- [x] (AC #3) Extend parity tests (`tests/integration/chat-jsonrpc.int.test.js` + golden fixture harness) to compare proto vs. app-server streaming transcripts and fail on ordering or finish-reason drift. [Source: docs/test-design-epic-2.md#test-coverage-plan] [Source: docs/openai-endpoint-golden-parity.md#streaming-transcript-matrix]
  - [x] (AC #3) Update `scripts/fake-codex-jsonrpc.js` and captured fixtures so tool-call and error streams exercise the adapter. [Source: docs/app-server-migration/codex-completions-api-migration.md#d-streaming-path-sse]

## Dev Notes

- Gate the adapter behind `BACKEND_APP_SERVER` so proto path remains unchanged while JSON-RPC streams reuse normalization context and transport lifecycle. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md#workflows-and-sequencing]
- Track `first_token_ms` and total duration using the existing metrics helpers and append structured stream logs before closing responses to satisfy latency and observability commitments. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md#performance] [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md#observability]
- Accumulate tool-call deltas and usage counters from `agentMessage*` and `tokenCount` events, falling back to existing estimators only when server totals are absent. [Source: docs/app-server-migration/codex-completions-api-migration.md#d-streaming-path-sse]
- Preserve disconnect behaviour (idle timeout, client abort) and guard release semantics when swapping adapters to avoid regressions under load. [Source: docs/app-server-migration/codex-completions-api-migration.md#g-concurrency--timeouts]

### Learnings from Previous Story

- `normalizeChatJsonRpcRequest` already emits normalized payloads and include_usage flags—reuse its outputs to seed stream context instead of recalculating. [Source: docs/stories/2-2-implement-request-translation-layer.md#completion-notes-list]
- Story 2.2 introduced `tests/integration/chat-jsonrpc.int.test.js`; extend the suite rather than creating a new harness to keep parity coverage centralized. [Source: docs/stories/2-2-implement-request-translation-layer.md#dev-notes]
- Review flagged reinstating `@openai/codex` pin (0.53.0) as high-priority follow-up—coordinate if streaming adapter requires newer schema regeneration. [Source: docs/stories/2-2-implement-request-translation-layer.md#learnings-from-previous-story]

### Project Structure Notes

- Implement streaming logic in `src/handlers/chat/stream.js` alongside existing SSE plumbing and concurrency guard. [Source: docs/architecture.md#integration-points]
- Extend `src/services/transport/appServerClient.js` / `child-adapter.js` to fan out JSON-RPC notifications to the handler without duplicating worker management. [Source: docs/stories/2-2-implement-request-translation-layer.md#project-structure-notes] [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md#apis-and-interfaces]
- Update `tests/integration/chat-jsonrpc.int.test.js` and parity fixtures under `docs/app-server-migration/` for streaming comparisons. [Source: docs/test-design-epic-2.md#test-coverage-plan]
