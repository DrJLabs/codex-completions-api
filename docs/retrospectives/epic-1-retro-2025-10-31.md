# Epic 1 Retrospective Summary (2025-10-31)

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
✅ RETROSPECTIVE COMPLETE

Epic 1: App-Server Platform Foundation - REVIEWED

Key Takeaways:
- Shared handlers, configs, and sequential slicing kept implementation friction low across six stories.
- Investment in supervisor/transport testing paid off; full unit, integration, and Playwright coverage held the line on quality.
- Parity evidence needs automation next—manual transcript checks are the biggest risk entering Epic 2.

Action Items Committed: 4
Preparation Tasks Defined: 7
Critical Path Items: 3

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🎯 NEXT STEPS:

1. Execute Preparation Sprint (Est: 6 days)
2. Complete Critical Path items before Epic 2
3. Review action items in next standup
4. Begin Epic 2 planning when preparation complete

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Scrum Master: "Great work team! We learned a lot from Epic 1.
Let's use these insights to make Epic 2 even better.
See you at sprint planning once prep work is done!"

## Action Items

- **Process Improvements**
  1. Stand up lightweight velocity tracking _(Owner: Bob, Due: 2025-11-03)_
  2. Lock stakeholder review checkpoints into parity checklist draft _(Owner: John, Due: 2025-11-04)_
  3. Schedule proto-vs-app parity brief with QA/Product leads _(Owner: John, Due: 2025-11-05)_

- **Documentation**
  - Publish updated system diagram (supervisor + transport layers) _(Owner: Winston, Due: 2025-11-06)_

## Preparation Sprint Tasks (Epic 2 Readiness)

- Establish JSON-RPC schema binding generator and type definitions _(Owner: Amelia, Est: 1.5 days)_
- Extend CI to run app-server integration smoke in both backend modes _(Owner: Murat, Est: 1 day)_
- Capture proto chat transcripts and matching JSON-RPC fixtures _(Owner: Mary, Est: 1 day)_
- Spike parity diff harness _(Owner: Murat, Est: 1.5 days)_
- Add backend-mode guard-rail tests for chat handlers _(Owner: Amelia, Est: 0.5 day)_
- Refresh supervisor/transport integration suite in app-server mode _(Owner: Winston, Est: 0.5 day)_
- Draft parity checklist and stakeholder briefing outline _(Owner: John, Est: 1 day)_

## Critical Path

1. Deterministic transcript fixture library available _(Owner: Mary, Target: 2025-11-05)_
2. Automated parity diff tooling ready for integration _(Owner: Murat, Target: 2025-11-06)_
3. Deploy Epic 1 foundation to target environment _(Owner: drj, Target: 2025-11-05)_

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Fixture quality drift** → Validate proto/app transcripts with spot checks before wiring diff harness.
- **CI runtime increase** → Measure parity suite cost during spike and adjust test selection if it exceeds budget.
