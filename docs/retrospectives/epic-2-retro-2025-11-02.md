NEXT EPIC PREVIEW: Epic 3: Observability & Ops Hardening

Dependencies on Epic 2:

- Story 2.2 request normalization feeds Epic 3 metrics instrumentation
- Story 2.3 streaming adapter telemetry provides latency data for observability stories
- Story 2.4 error mapping baseline underpins alert thresholds in Epic 3
- Story 2.5 manifest + parity harness outputs power audit evidence for new dashboards
- Story 2.6 rollout checklist sets review cadence for Epic 3 operational work

Preparation Needed:

- Formalize structured logging schema before onboarding Epic 3 stories
- Stand up Prometheus dashboards + alert routes for new metrics
- Run stakeholder tabletop using the parity checklist to rehearse review cadence

Technical Prerequisites:

- Confirm Prometheus/Alertmanager access and environment credentials
- Validate logging sink supports new lifecycle fields without truncation
- Enable staging trace-buffer toggles and retention guards for observability exercises

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Team assembled for reflection:

- Bob (Scrum Master)
- Sarah (Product Owner)
- Amelia (Developer)
- Quinn (QA)
- Winston (Architect)
- Mary (Analyst)

Focus Areas:

1. Learning from Epic 2 execution
2. Preparing for Epic 3 success

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## Part 1 – Epic 2 Reflection

**Bob (Scrum Master):** Celebrated that all seven parity stories finished without rollover and highlighted disciplined workflow usage—each story hit review gates with explicit AC evidence. Noted the sole blocker surfaced in Story 2.4’s review; praised the quick follow-up commit and emphasized the value of holding reviews to strict evidence standards.

**Sarah (Product Owner):** Pointed out that every acceptance criterion across the epic now has traceable documentation (especially Story 2.6’s checklist) and stakeholders can evaluate readiness asynchronously. Flagged that external sign-off remains outstanding and should be scheduled promptly.

**Amelia (Developer):** Called out the reusable normalization/streaming helpers (Stories 2.2 & 2.3) as major wins that kept later stories lean. Suggested automating smoke evidence archival to avoid manual copy/paste when Story 2.6 runs before operations reviews.

**Quinn (QA):** Highlighted the depth of parity validation—`npm run transcripts:generate`, `npm run test:parity`, `npm run test:integration`, `npm test`, and `npm run smoke:dev` all ran for Stories 2.5 and 2.6. Requested an expanded transport error test matrix so Epic 3 monitoring stories inherit stronger negative coverage.

**Winston (Architect):** Appreciated that transport and handler refactors preserved proto behavior. Noted an architectural gap: structured logging fields referenced in Epic 3 are not yet standardized; recommends adding a schema before metrics work begins.

**Mary (Analyst):** Observed that documentation threads (Stories 2.5 & 2.6) provide a solid audit trail but suggested preparing an operations-facing summary to accelerate stakeholder education before Epic 3 retrospectives.

### Themes

- **Successes:** Shared test infrastructure, disciplined review cycles, comprehensive documentation.
- **Challenges:** Manual smoke evidence capture; initial regression in error handling; lack of standardized logging schema.
- **Insights:** Reusable helpers reduce scope creep; early review findings are healthy; documentation plus manifest data accelerates stakeholder trust.

## Part 2 – Preparing for Epic 3

**Bob (Scrum Master):** Proposed a short preparation sprint to tackle logging schema, dashboard setup, and smoke automation before story kickoff.

**Sarah (Product Owner):** Will coordinate the stakeholder tabletop using the Story 2.6 checklist to secure external approvals prior to Epic 3 execution.

**Amelia (Developer):** Needs logging schema definitions and metric destination details to avoid code churn; volunteers to extend transport error tests during prep.

**Quinn (QA):** Requests time to script smoke evidence archival and to draft alert acceptance tests derived from Story 2.6 metrics expectations.

**Winston (Architect):** Plans to document structured logging contracts and review Prometheus topology to ensure telemetry endpoints align with Epic 3 objectives.

**Mary (Analyst):** Will compile an ops training brief summarizing parity evidence, smoke workflows, and upcoming observability goals for cross-team alignment.

### Anticipated Risks

- Delay in Prometheus/Alertmanager access could stall metrics work → schedule infra review by 2025-11-04.
- Stakeholder availability for the parity checklist tabletop may slip → send invites now with agenda tied to Story 2.6 artifacts.

## Action Plan

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
📝 EPIC 2 ACTION ITEMS:

Process Improvements:

1. Automate smoke evidence archival into `./artifacts/smoke/{env}/` (Owner: Quinn, By: 2025-11-06)
2. Schedule parity checklist tabletop with QA/SRE/Product stakeholders (Owner: Sarah, By: 2025-11-05)
3. Add review checklist reminder to workflow kickoff templates (Owner: Bob, By: 2025-11-04)

Technical Debt:

1. Expand transport error test matrix beyond current scenarios (Owner: Amelia, Priority: Medium)
2. Document structured logging schema assumptions for metrics integration (Owner: Winston, Priority: Low)

Documentation:

1. Produce parity rollout ops briefing deck (Owner: Mary, By: 2025-11-06)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🚀 EPIC 3 PREPARATION SPRINT:

Technical Setup:
[ ] Implement structured worker lifecycle logging schema (Owner: Amelia, Est: 16h)
[ ] Provision Prometheus dashboards and alert routes (Owner: Winston, Est: 12h)

Knowledge Development:
[ ] Compile ops training brief and deliver stakeholder walkthrough (Owner: Mary, Est: 8h)
[ ] Host alerting workshop aligning QA + SRE test plans (Owner: Quinn, Est: 6h)

Cleanup/Refactoring:
[ ] Audit transport logging for PII and retention policies (Owner: Amelia, Est: 8h)
[ ] Prune obsolete proto-only integration fixtures (Owner: Quinn, Est: 6h)

Documentation:
[ ] Draft structured logging ADR for Epic 3 baseline (Owner: Winston, Est: 6h)
[ ] Update migration runbook with smoke evidence archival steps (Owner: Sarah, Est: 4h)

Total Estimated Effort: 66 hours (≈8 days)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
⚠️ CRITICAL PATH:

Blockers to Resolve Before Epic 3:

1. Finalize structured logging schema (Owner: Winston, Must complete by: 2025-11-08)
2. Confirm Prometheus/Alertmanager credentials for staging and prod (Owner: Quinn, Must complete by: 2025-11-08)

Dependencies Timeline:

- Logging schema → Metrics dashboards → Alert rule validation → Stakeholder tabletop

Risk Mitigation:

- Metrics pipeline access delay: Schedule infra readiness review (Mitigation Owner: Winston)
- Stakeholder availability: Circulate parity checklist briefing with RSVP deadline (Mitigation Owner: Sarah)

## Readiness Check

- **Testing and Quality:** Full suite executed (unit, integration, parity, Playwright, smoke); confident in parity readiness.
- **Deployment and Release:** Documentation prepared; production cutover pending Epic 4 schedule—no immediate deployment blocking Epic 3.
- **Stakeholder Acceptance:** Internal approvals complete; external stakeholder review slated via tabletop (action item #2).
- **Technical Health:** Codebase stable; must add structured logging schema and extend transport tests before Epic 3.
- **Unresolved Blockers:** None outstanding after Story 2.4 fix; critical path items tracked above.
