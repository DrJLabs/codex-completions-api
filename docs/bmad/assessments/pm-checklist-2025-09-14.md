# PM Checklist Validation — Codex Completions API (PRD)

Date: 2025-09-14
Mode: YOLO (all-at-once)
Sources: `docs/bmad/prd.md`, `docs/bmad/architecture.md`, `docs/brownfield-architecture.md`

## Executive Summary

The PRD is implementation‑oriented and strong on API compatibility, configuration, and smoke/E2E verification. It is intentionally light on market/problem framing (as this is an infra/service artifact). MVP scope is reasonable for a backend proxy, but problem definition, business goals/KPIs, and user research are minimal or out of scope. Overall readiness for architecture is “Ready”, as the system already exists and the PRD captures current behavior and expectations.

Overall PRD Completeness: ~75% (PARTIAL)
MVP Scope: Just Right (for infra proxy)
Readiness for Architecture: READY
Top Concerns: Missing business goals/KPIs; UX sections mostly N/A; expand NFRs and operational expectations.

## Category Analysis

| Category                         | Status  | Critical Issues |
| -------------------------------- | ------- | --------------- |
| 1. Problem Definition & Context  | PARTIAL | No explicit business goals/KPIs; minimal user persona context. |
| 2. MVP Scope Definition          | PASS    | Scope bounded to OpenAI parity + SSE contract + smoke tests. |
| 3. User Experience Requirements  | N/A     | Backend proxy; no UI flows. |
| 4. Functional Requirements       | PASS    | Routes, verbs, error envelopes, examples present. |
| 5. Non-Functional Requirements   | PARTIAL | Basic SLI targets noted; add throughput, availability targets, and env profiles. |
| 6. Epic & Story Structure        | PARTIAL | Stories not enumerated; can derive from parity gaps and ops improvements. |
| 7. Technical Guidance            | PASS    | Clear architectural constraints and integration notes. |
| 8. Cross-Functional Requirements | PARTIAL | Ops/monitoring guidance present but thin; data is N/A. |
| 9. Clarity & Communication       | PASS    | Docs are structured and versioned; references included. |

## Top Issues by Priority

- BLOCKERS: None for current scope.
- HIGH:
  - Add “Business Goals & Success Metrics” section to PRD with measurable KPIs (e.g., stream TTFC p95, error rate <1%).
  - Define environment profiles (dev/prod) with recommended CORS, gating, and rate‑limit settings.
- MEDIUM:
  - Expand NFRs: throughput/replica, SSE concurrency envelope, resource budgets.
  - Add “Operational Runbook” reference and link.
- LOW:
  - Optional background on target developer personas and client tool matrix.

## MVP Scope Assessment

- Scope appears tight: health, models, chat/completions (non‑stream/stream), error shapes, and smoke/E2E verification.
- Consider trimming any experimental toggles from MVP, keeping defaults sane and documented.

## Technical Readiness

- Constraints: Stateless, bearer auth, optional model gating, SSE keepalive behavior, stream cut/suppress toggles.
- Risks: CLI child availability, ingress timeouts, browser CORS behavior variability.
- Needs: Clear env‑profile table; explicit SLI targets (response, TTFC, availability), light observability guidance.

## Recommendations

1. Add a “Business Goals & KPIs” section to `docs/bmad/prd.md` with concrete targets.
2. Add an “Environment Profiles” table mapping dev/prod flags and defaults.
3. Link or author `docs/runbooks/operational.md` and reference it from PRD.
4. Derive a short epic/story list to track parity deltas and operability improvements.

## Final Decision

NEEDS REFINEMENT (non‑blocking) — Ready for architecture, with PM follow‑ups above.
