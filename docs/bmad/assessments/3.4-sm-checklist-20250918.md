| 1. Goal & Context Clarity            | PASS   | Story captures user persona, dependency on Story 3.3, and business value around deterministic 429 enforcement.          |
| 2. Technical Implementation Guidance | PASS   | Tasks identify handler updates, semaphore guard, config gating, test harness improvements with precise file references. |
| 3. Reference Effectiveness           | PASS   | Sources cite architecture sections and the new analyst research brief with deep links for each technical decision.      |
| 4. Self-Containment Assessment       | PASS   | Research insights summarize key findings; assumptions, telemetry expectations, and docs to update are explicit.         |
| 5. Testing Guidance                  | PASS   | Testing section enumerates verify:all, focused Vitest runs, and optional smoke with toggle validation.                  |

**Summary:** Story 3.4 is READY for handoff. No blockers identified.

**Follow-ups:** Ensure PO and QA run their respective validations after development kickoff.
