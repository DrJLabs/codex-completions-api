# Architect Checklist Validation — Codex Completions API

## Executive Summary

Overall architecture is sound, modular, and aligned with the stated goal: an OpenAI‑compatible proxy fronting a Codex CLI child process. HTTP contracts (non‑stream/stream) and CORS are well defined; streaming semantics (stable id/created, role‑first delta, usage finalization) are validated by tests. Security model (bearer + optional models gating) and ForwardAuth sidecar are clearly documented. In‑app rate limiting is present as defense‑in‑depth; edge RL expected in Traefik/Cloudflare. Biggest gaps are around formal non-functional targets beyond SSE timing, reliability/runbook details for failures, and explicit disaster/rollback procedures.

Status: PASS (architecture); PARTIAL (reliability/operability); PARTIAL (formal performance targets beyond SSE);

## Section Results (Pass Rates)

| Section                        | Status  | Notes                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------ | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Requirements Alignment      | PARTIAL | PRD focuses on API parity and smoke criteria; lacks problem statement/metrics. (`docs/bmad/prd.md`)  |
| 2. Architecture Completeness   | PASS    | Clear module boundaries, routes, handlers, SSE behavior, envs. (`docs/bmad/architecture.md`)         |
| 3. Security Model              | PASS    | Bearer, optional models gating, ForwardAuth documented. (`src/routes/models.js`, `auth/server.mjs`)  |
| 4. Performance                 | PARTIAL | SSE TTFC target noted; broader perf/throughput not quantified; no load profile.                      |
| 5. Reliability & Failure Modes | PARTIAL | Timeouts/idle paths covered; no explicit rollback/runbook for degraded child CLI or Traefik outages. |
| 6. Observability               | PARTIAL | Structured JSON access log; no metrics/export or error taxonomy dashboard.                           |
| 7. Data & State                | N/A     | Stateless; no DB.                                                                                    |
| 8. Delivery & Verification     | PASS    | `verify:all`, integration + E2E tests; smoke for dev/prod paths.                                     |
| 9. Security Hardening          | PARTIAL | CORS defaults permissive by design; guidelines present but not parameterized per env.                |

## Evidence Highlights

- Routes and shapes: `src/routes/{chat,models,health}.js`, `src/handlers/chat/{stream,nonstream}.js`.
- SSE helpers and keepalives: `src/services/sse.js`.
- Config/envs: `src/config/index.js`, `src/config/models.js`.
- Rate limiting: `src/middleware/rate-limit.js`.
- Tests validating API/SSE: `tests/integration/*`, `tests/sse-*.spec.js`, `tests/e2e/*`.
- ForwardAuth: `auth/server.mjs`.

## Key Findings

- Requirements alignment: PRD captures API parity and acceptance checks but lacks explicit business goals and user personas (appropriate for infra service, but mark as PARTIAL).
- Performance: Targets specified for TTFC and response but no throughput/load or resource envelope (CPU/mem per stream). Add SLI targets per route.
- Reliability: Graceful shutdown present; guidance for child process failures/timeouts exists, but no runbook for Codex CLI unavailability or Traefik misroutes.
- Observability: Structured access log is present; no metrics/trace export, no counter of 4xx/5xx by route, no SSE concurrency metric outside test endpoint.

## Recommendations

1. Add a short Operational Runbook in `docs/runbooks/operational.md`:
   - Symptoms → Causes → Checks → Fixes for: child spawn failure, CLI timeouts, edge 502/504, CORS misconfig, ForwardAuth token failures.
2. Perf SLIs: Document p95 throughput per replica and memory/FD budgets (SSE concurrency), with example tuning (`PROXY_SSE_MAX_CONCURRENCY`, `ulimit -n`).
3. Observability: Add minimal metrics export (per-route counts, error codes, SSE conc) or document external log parsing with example queries.
4. Security: Provide env-profile guidance (strict CORS when behind trusted origins; leave permissive only for browser clients) and add a small table mapping env → recommended flags.
5. Disaster/rollback: Document quick rollback for Docker Compose (revert image tag) and ForwardAuth bypass toggle for emergency triage.

## Final Decision

- Architecture: READY
- Operability: NEEDS REFINEMENT (follow recommendations 1–5)

Appendix — Notable Gaps Tracked

- No DB/state by design → N/A for data modeling.
- No explicit rate-limit headers beyond 429 + Retry-After.
- No automated health probes for child CLI beyond request-scoped timeouts.
