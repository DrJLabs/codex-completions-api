  assessor: Quinn (Test Architect)
  decision: PASS
  rationale:
    - Server bootstrap is thin; no inline POST/spawn remains
    - Structured access logs emit required fields; X-Request-Id correlates
    - External API shapes unchanged; integration + E2E suites green
    - Usage endpoints validated via new router
