  date: 2025-09-12
  version: 1
  decision: PASS
  rationale: |
    Services extracted with parity preserved. Integration and E2E green; perf smoke within thresholds.
    Minor observability assertion gap noted (non-blocking). Risk posture Medium overall with mitigations.
  evidence:
    integration_tests: "22 passed, 2 skipped"
    e2e_tests: "9 passed"
    perf_smoke: "TTFC p95 < 2s; total p95 < 5s"
