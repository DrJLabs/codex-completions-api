story_title: "Story 6.1 — Responses Endpoint Handlers"
gate: PASS
status_reason: >-
  Regression coverage now exercises streaming tool-call aggregation, abort-driven shutdown, metadata
  sanitizer toggles, and default usage behaviour directly on `/v1/responses`; freshly captured
  transcripts (via `node scripts/generate-responses-transcripts.mjs --codex …`) align the typed SSE
  contract, so the story meets acceptance without outstanding blocking risks.
