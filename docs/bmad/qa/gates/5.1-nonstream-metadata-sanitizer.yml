  _assessed: [security, performance, reliability, maintainability]
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Telemetry redaction removes rollout/session keys from client output while logging sanitized keys for audit."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "String filtering executes in-process with negligible overhead; integration run shows no latency regression."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Toggle defaults to false for safe rollout and logs sanitized counts to detect anomalies."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Helper module, unit tests, and `.env.example` guidance simplify future reuse (including streaming parity)."

    - action: "Enable `PROXY_SANITIZE_METADATA` in staging post-deploy and monitor sanitized key metrics for unexpected values."
