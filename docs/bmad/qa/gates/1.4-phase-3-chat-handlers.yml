gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: >-
  Pre-implementation review: key risks identified (SSE semantics; tool-block cut/tail parity).
  NFR shows Security and Performance concerns. Test design and trace are prepared.
  Gate will move to PASS after implementation with green CI and smoke.

    title: "SSE semantics regression (role-first delta, [DONE])"
    severity: high
    mitigation: >-
      Preserve SSE helpers; assert role-first chunk and [DONE]; verify keepalive toggles.

    title: "Tool-block cut/tail suppression parity"
    severity: high
    mitigation: >-
      Reuse parser; add unit fixtures; verify dedup + delimiter and early cut/tail suppression.

  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - "Add/verify E2E for role-first chunk and [DONE] terminator"
      - "Unit-test tool-block cut/tail suppression and dedup logic"
    monitor:
      - "Watch SSE disconnects/timeouts and error rates post-deploy"
      - "Compare TTFC/latency vs pre-refactor baselines"

  _assessed: [security, performance, reliability, maintainability]
  security:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "No app-level rate limiting; rely on edge. SSE abuse controls limited to idle timeouts."
  performance:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Targets undefined; add TTFC/p95 baselines and optional perf smoke."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Timeouts, SSE contract, and disconnect handling in place."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Router/handler extraction improves structure; tests/docs planned."
conditions_to_pass:
  - "Extract chat/completions into handlers/router with zero external behavior change; remove inline routes from server.js."
  - "Preserve SSE contract: role-first delta, stable id, [DONE]; keepalive toggles verified; E2E green."
  - "Maintain tool-block behaviors: early cut and tail suppression; unit tests for parser/dedup."
  - "Ensure HEAD/OPTIONS parity for /v1/chat/completions and /v1/completions."
  - "Implement or document rate limiting (edge or app) for chat endpoints."
  - "Define performance targets and optional perf smoke; verify locally."
  - "Cleanup timers/intervals on disconnect; verify PROXY_KILL_ON_DISCONNECT semantics."
