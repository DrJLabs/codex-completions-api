nfr_validation:
  _assessed: [performance, reliability, maintainability]
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Smoke harness benchmarking (2025-09-24) showed ~0.12s wall time, peak RSS 56.3 MB vs 57.0 MB (∆ 0.7 MB), CPU <0.05s user/<0.02s system; current PROXY_TOOL_BLOCK_MAX=16 remains sufficient."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Shared aggregator + updated transcripts ensure consistent tool-call ordering across stream/non-stream handlers."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Dedicated helper, unit coverage, and smoke harness artifacts reduce regression risk for solo developers."

recommendations:
  immediate:
    - action: "Publish benchmarking summary alongside release checklist and ensure canary telemetry stays within captured envelope."
