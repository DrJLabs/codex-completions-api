## Summary

Story 2.5 validates non‑stream (`stream:false`) parity for `/v1/chat/completions` covering response shape, `finish_reason` mapping (`stop|length`), `usage` presence, and `model` consistency with streaming. Tests confirm expected behavior using the proto shims.

## Evidence

- Integration tests (green):
  - tests/integration/chat.nonstream.shape.int.test.js — shape + `finish_reason:"stop"`.
  - tests/integration/chat.nonstream.length.int.test.js — simulated truncation → `finish_reason:"length"` + `usage` present.
  - tests/integration/chat.model.consistency.int.test.js — stream vs non‑stream `model` equality.
- Docs updated:
  - docs/openai-chat-completions-parity.md → verification references.
  - Epic linked to Story 2.5 under Phase F.
- QA artifacts: Risk, Test Design, Trace, NFR are present and consistent.

## Decision

PASS — Ready to merge. No code changes required; tests lock in parity.

## Follow‑ups

- Consider adding a live E2E smoke validating non‑stream `finish_reason` mapping against the dev stack.
