## Scope & Summary

Story 3.4 reworks the SSE concurrency guard to use a semaphore helper, adds test-only instrumentation, and strengthens integration coverage. Evaluation focuses on performance, reliability, observability, and security/regulatory posture of the new guard paths and endpoints.

## Quality Attributes

- Performance: LOW IMPACT — Semaphore bookkeeping adds a pair of integer operations per stream. Integration + Playwright suites (`npm run verify:all`) show unchanged latency; no additional child processes spawn on rejected requests.
- Reliability: IMPROVED — Idempotent release handlers for `close`, `finish`, and `aborted` events eliminate phantom active counts and race conditions identified in issue 2025-09-12. Repeated integration loops confirm deterministic 429 behavior.
- Security: GUARDED — Test-only headers and endpoints are gated by `PROXY_TEST_ENDPOINTS`. When disabled (default in prod), no new surface area is exposed. No secrets logged; guard telemetry uses request IDs already present in structured logs.
- Observability: ENHANCED — `[proxy][sse_guard]` structured logs capture acquisition, rejection, and release with counts, enabling rapid diagnosis. `/__test/conc` provides optional insight when debugging in controlled environments.
- Maintainability: IMPROVED — Guard logic now lives in `src/services/concurrency-guard.js`, isolating state management and making future changes easier to test.

## Risks & Mitigations

- Risk: Test endpoints accidentally enabled in production.
  - Mitigation: Flag defaults to false; runbook documents verification; integration test ensures headers absent when disabled.
- Risk: Release file mechanism left behind in prod leading to unexpected shim behavior.
  - Mitigation: Release helper only used in tests; runbook reminds teams to disable/test endpoints after debugging; guard still functions without the file.
- Risk: Increased logging volume.
  - Mitigation: Guard logs emit one JSON line per lifecycle; acceptable overhead and invaluable for troubleshooting.

## Validation

- Automation: `npm run verify:all` (format, lint, unit, integration, Playwright) — includes updated rate-limit integration loop and SSE contract suite.
- Manual/Docs: docs/openai-chat-completions-parity.md and docs/dev-to-prod-playbook.md updated with guard behavior and monitoring guidance; issue 2025-09-12 closed with evidence.

## Decision

NFR Status: PASS — No additional hardening required. Recommend adding temporary log monitoring post-deploy to confirm acquisition/release parity.
