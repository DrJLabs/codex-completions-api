## Template Compliance

- Sections present: Status, Story, Acceptance Criteria, Tasks/Subtasks, Dev Notes, Testing, Change Log, Dev Agent Record, QA Results → PASS
- Placeholders: None found. → PASS
- Structure: Follows Story Template v2 intent → PASS

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)

- None.

## Should-Fix (Quality Improvements)

- Add explicit dependency note: “Depends on completion of Story 1.4.”
- Under Dev Notes → Project Structure Notes, reiterate destination paths (`src/services/*`) since `source-tree.md` is placeholder.

## Nice-to-Have

- Link to any existing test files once created in Phase 4 for traceability (to be filled by Dev/QA later).

## Anti-Hallucination Review

- All technical claims map to `docs/bmad/architecture.md` and `docs/bmad/architecture/server-modularization-refactor.md`. No invented libraries or patterns detected. → PASS

## Final Assessment

- Decision: GO
- Implementation Readiness Score: 9/10
- Confidence: High
