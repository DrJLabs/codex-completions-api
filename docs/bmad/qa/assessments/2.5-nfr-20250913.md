## Summary

- Decision: PASS
- Evidence: Added integration tests for non‑stream shape, truncation (length), and model consistency; `npm run test:integration` is green.
- Change validated: No production code changes necessary; existing handlers already meet ACs.

## Targets & Evidence

- Security — PASS
  - No changes to auth or input handling.
  - Error behaviors unchanged; only success path verified.

- Performance — PASS
  - Tests only; runtime estimator fallback already present and O(n chars).

- Reliability — PASS
  - Non‑stream finish_reason mapping deterministic (based on presence of `task_complete`).
  - Estimator fallback ensures `usage` present even without explicit `token_count`.

- Maintainability — PASS
  - Tests lock expected parity; story and spec link to concrete tests.

- Compatibility — PASS
  - Model string parity between stream and non‑stream validated.
  - Shape and `finish_reason` match OpenAI expectations.

- Observability — PASS
  - Existing usage logging unchanged; no new branches added.
