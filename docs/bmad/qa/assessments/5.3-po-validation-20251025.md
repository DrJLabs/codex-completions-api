## PO Validation

- Template Compliance: PASS — Story contains complete sections with up-to-date QA Results, gate reference, and linked assessments; no placeholders remain.
- Acceptance Criteria: AC1–AC4 confirmed via trace matrix (`docs/bmad/qa/assessments/5.3-trace-20251025.md`). Unit/integration tests cover telemetry summaries and toggle transitions, while docs/runbook updates were cross-checked during QA review.
- Risks/Dependencies: Residual operational dependency is capturing telemetry artifacts when staging enables the toggle (QA Recommendation #1) and scheduling the perf sweep (Recommendation #2). Risk profile (`docs/bmad/qa/assessments/5.3-risk-20251024.md`) rates unresolved risks medium; mitigations are owned by DevOps.
- Decision: GO — implementation ready 9.2/10 with High confidence.

## Validation Report

### Template Compliance Issues

- None.

### Critical Issues (Must Fix)

- None.

### Should-Fix Issues (Important Quality Improvements)

1. Ensure QA artifact collection (toggle log samples, parser output) happens before the production toggle flip so evidence exists for rollout audits.

### Nice-to-Have Improvements (Optional Enhancements)

1. Add a short operator-facing FAQ in the runbook referencing expected sanitized key names to speed investigations.

### Anti-Hallucination Findings

- All statements backed by linked assessments, risk profile, and updated documentation. No unsupported claims detected.

### Final Assessment

- Decision: GO
- Implementation Readiness Score: 9.2/10
- Confidence Level: High

## Summary

- Story deliverables, QA assessments, and documentation updates are aligned; telemetry helpers and runbook guidance satisfy rollout requirements.
- Next actions center on staging telemetry capture and scheduling the load/performance validation prior to production rollout.
