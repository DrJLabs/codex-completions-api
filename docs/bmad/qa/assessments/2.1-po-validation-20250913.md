## Template Compliance

- Sections present: Status, Story, Acceptance Criteria, Tasks/Subtasks, Dev Notes, Testing, QA Results, Change Log, Dev Agent Record → PASS
- Placeholders: None found → PASS
- Structure: Follows Story Template intent → PASS

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)

- None.

## Should-Fix (Quality Improvements)

- In AC1, optionally enumerate the spec sections explicitly (non‑stream fields, streaming order and chunk semantics, error envelope, params) to mirror the task wording for tighter traceability.

## Nice-to-Have

- Add a short “Scope & Non‑Goals” line in the spec (e.g., logprobs/tool_calls out‑of‑scope if not targeted).

## Anti-Hallucination Review

- All claims map to project docs; no invented APIs or dependencies detected. → PASS

## Final Assessment

- Decision: GO
- Implementation Readiness Score: 9/10
