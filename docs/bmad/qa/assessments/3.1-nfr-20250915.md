# NFR Assessment: Story 3.1

## Performance

- Dev non‑stream now returns < 60 s via early finalize (finish_reason:"length"). Streaming remains < 5 s for short prompts.
- Recommendation: Keep PROXY_DEV_TRUNCATE_AFTER_MS at 60 s; consider 30–45 s if needed.

## Reliability

- Edge 524 eliminated by deterministic early finalize in dev; prod unchanged.
- Suggest adding a dashboard for dev edge non‑stream success rate and p95 latency.

## Security

- No auth changes; ForwardAuth continues to guard POST routes. CORS handled at edge.

## Maintainability

- Dev‑only guard controlled by env `PROXY_DEV_TRUNCATE_AFTER_MS`; zero disables. Code path cancels when backend completes.

## Operations

- Cloudflare ruleset expression updated to `/v1/chat/completions` for dev cache rule.
- Runbook section added for triage.

## Decision

- NFR risk: Low. Proceed with guard in dev; no change recommended for prod.
