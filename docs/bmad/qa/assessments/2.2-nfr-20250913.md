## Summary

- Decision: PASS
- Evidence: `npm run verify:all` passed (Unit 17/17, Integration 25/25 with 2 skipped, E2E 10/10) after implementing ordering fix.
- Change validated: finish_reason chunk now precedes the optional usage chunk; stream ends with `[DONE]`.

## Targets & Evidence

- Security — PASS
  - Bearer auth enforced (401 with `WWW-Authenticate`), models endpoint unprotected in tests only.
  - Rate limiting present; SSE concurrency guard enabled. Tests configure higher conc only for CI to avoid false 429s.
  - No new secrets introduced; envs documented; JSON body size and CORS policies unchanged.

- Performance — PASS
  - Perf smoke (`tests/e2e/perf-smoke.spec.ts`) within thresholds (TTFC p95 < 2000 ms; total p95 < 5000 ms) on shim backend.
  - Ordering change does not add extra round trips; emits two terminal frames (finish_reason, optional usage) then `[DONE]`.

- Reliability — PASS
  - Stable `id` and `created` across chunks upheld; finalization sequence deterministic: role → content\* → finish_reason → usage? → `[DONE]`.
  - Idle/overall timeouts and `[DONE]` termination already covered in integration tests.

- Maintainability — PASS
  - Handler now buffers token counts and emits usage after finalizer; logic localized in `src/handlers/chat/stream.js` with minimal surface area.
  - Tests codify ordering (`tests/sse-finish-reason-order.spec.js`) to prevent regressions.

- Compatibility — PASS
  - Aligns with OpenAI streaming semantics for finish_reason and optional usage chunk.
  - Non‑stream shapes unchanged; `finish_reason` populated appropriately.

- Observability — PASS
  - Existing structured access logs and dev proto logs remain; usage counters appended at completion.
  - Suggest adding dashboard counters for finish_reason types (stop/length) in future work (non‑blocking).

## Risks & Notes

- Test env sets `PROXY_SSE_MAX_CONCURRENCY=12` to avoid CI false positives; production defaults remain conservative.
- Golden transcripts should be refreshed to reflect the explicit finish_reason chunk (tracked in Story 2.1/fixtures).

## Gate YAML (copy/paste)

```yaml
nfr_validation:
  _assessed: [security, performance, reliability, maintainability, compatibility, observability]
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Bearer auth + rate limit + SSE conc guard"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Perf smoke within thresholds; no extra latency from ordering"
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Deterministic finalization; stable id/created; [DONE] respected"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Small localized change; ordering enforced by tests"
  compatibility:
    status: PASS
    notes: "OpenAI parity for finish_reason and usage sequence"
  observability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Access/proto logs intact; usage counters appended"
```

## Recommendations

1. Add a tiny integration assertion that `created` is identical across all streamed chunks (already implied; explicit check adds safety).
2. Publish updated golden NDJSON for both with/without usage paths to lock behavior for future CI comparisons.
