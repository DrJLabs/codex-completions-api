## Quick Summary

- Story readiness: READY
- Clarity score: 9/10
- Major gaps: Source tree doc is placeholder; dependency on Story 1.4 not explicitly marked as dependency (not blocking).

## Section Results

| Category                             | Status     | Issues                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Goal & Context Clarity            | ✅ PASS    | Add explicit dependency note on 1.4 completion.                                                      |
| 2. Technical Implementation Guidance | ✅ PASS    | —                                                                                                    |
| 3. Reference Effectiveness           | ✅ PASS    | Citations use section anchors; acceptable.                                                           |
| 4. Self-Containment Assessment       | ⚠️ PARTIAL | `docs/bmad/architecture/source-tree.md` is a placeholder; story compensates by listing target paths. |
| 5. Testing Guidance                  | ✅ PASS    | —                                                                                                    |

## Specific Issues and Recommendations

- Self-Containment: Until `source-tree.md` is populated, keep explicit file paths under Dev Notes. Consider adding a short “Project Structure Notes” subsection referencing `src/services/*` and handlers.
- Dependencies: Add an explicit line under Status or Tasks noting dependency on completion of Story 1.4.

## Developer Perspective

- Implementable as written: Yes.
- Questions anticipated: None critical; confirm keepalive disable heuristics list is exhaustive (Electron/Obsidian/header/query).
- Potential delays: None expected.

## Final Assessment

- Overall: READY
- Rationale: Clear ACs, concrete file targets, preserved contracts, and test guidance. Minor documentation placeholder noted.
