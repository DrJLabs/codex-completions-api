## Scope

Evaluate security, performance, reliability, and maintainability implications of introducing the non-stream metadata sanitizer toggle and associated logging.

## Summary

- **Security — PASS**: Sanitizer removes rollout/session telemetry from client-visible payloads when enabled and records redacted keys for operator audit; no secrets written to disk.
- **Performance — PASS**: Filtering performs bounded string parsing in-process; integration runs (`npm run test:integration -- chat.nonstream.metadata.int.test.js`) show no added latency and default-off preserves legacy path.
- **Reliability — PASS**: Toggle defaults to false for staged rollout, usage logs expose sanitized counts to detect anomalies, and legacy behaviour remains untouched when disabled.
- **Maintainability — PASS**: Dedicated helper module with focused unit tests encapsulates logic; `.env.example` and story docs describe rollout, easing future parity work.

Quality Score: 100.

## Details & Recommendations

### Security (PASS)

- Sanitizer strips `rollout_path`/`session_id` lines and logs a structured summary (`metadata_sanitizer_enabled`, `sanitized_metadata_keys`).
- Recommendation: Enable the toggle in staging after deployment and verify logs for unexpected metadata keys before promoting to production.

### Performance (PASS)

- Operations are linear over short assistant content and rely on existing buffers; no additional subprocesses or I/O introduced.
- Recommendation: Include sanitizer-on scenarios in future load/regression runs once the toggle is enabled by default.

### Reliability (PASS)

- Integration tests cover toggle on/off to ensure stable behaviour; usage NDJSON metrics provide observability if sanitization fails.
- Recommendation: Add alerting on sanitized count spikes post-rollout to catch upstream schema changes.

### Maintainability (PASS)

- New `metadata-sanitizer` utility separates parsing logic from the handler, and tests document expected transformations.
- Recommendation: Reuse the helper for streaming parity to avoid duplicate logic across handlers.

## Decision

NFR Status: **PASS** — Story 5.1 satisfies assessed non-functional requirements.
