## Scope

Evaluate non-functional impacts of the canonical finish_reason mapper across the proxy, focusing on security, performance, reliability, and maintainability for solo operations.

## Summary

- **Security — PASS**: Canonicalization operates on in-memory metadata only; no new I/O or external calls. Telemetry logs omit request payloads and report sanitized reason strings.
- **Performance — PASS**: Normalization adds simple string comparisons and shared helper usage; benchmarks during `npm run verify:all` show no meaningful latency change.
- **Reliability — PASS**: Shared helper eliminates drift between streaming/non-stream handlers, and telemetry provides visibility for future unknown reasons.
- **Maintainability — PASS**: Tests, transcripts, and docs document behaviour; shared module keeps logic centralized.

Quality Score: 94.

## Details & Recommendations

### Security (PASS)

- Mapper rejects unknown reasons to `stop` while logging via `[proxy][finish_reason]`; no sensitive data logged.
- Recommendation: watch telemetry for unexpected reason values and add explicit allowlist entries when upstream models expand.

### Performance (PASS)

- Helper performs constant-time lookups; Playwright/contract suites show no added delays.
- Recommendation: retain lightweight unit coverage around normalization to guard against future regressions.

### Reliability (PASS)

- Fallback to `length` covers truncation scenarios lacking `task_complete`; integration tests verify canonical output in both channels.
- Recommendation: add automated alert using telemetry counts to detect spikes in `unknown` reasons.

### Maintainability (PASS)

- Shared helper plus updated docs reduce duplication; transcripts cover new scenarios for quick diffing.
- Recommendation: document telemetry log usage in `docs/dev-to-prod-playbook.md` during next ops update.

## Decision

NFR Status: **PASS** — Story 4.1 meets non-functional expectations and is ready to proceed.
