# QA Review Summary

- Validated sanitized telemetry helpers in `src/dev-logging.js` emit deduped toggle events and summary rows with sanitized key/source sets; unit tests cover the helper behavior and reset hook.
- Exercised non-stream and streaming integration suites with `PROXY_SANITIZE_METADATA` on/off; responses omit rollout metadata only when expected, usage NDJSON records sanitized key counts, and telemetry NDJSON contains the summary + toggle pairs used for alerting.
- Reviewed documentation updates (PRD FR11/NFR8, architecture observability section, tech stack testing guidance) plus the operational runbook’s new “Sanitizer QA Smoke” checklist; instructions align with the new `scripts/qa/parser-smoke.sh` helper and QA artifact README.
- Confirmed QA artifacts directory (`docs/bmad/qa/artifacts/5.3/`) defines required evidence (toggle event, summary event, parser smoke output) for future audits.

## Decision

PASS — ready for PO validation

- Acceptance criteria fully satisfied with automated coverage (unit + integration) and coordinated documentation/runbook updates.
- Telemetry evidence is traceable via QA artifacts and runbook instructions; no outstanding QA issues detected.

## Traceability

- Trace matrix `docs/bmad/qa/assessments/5.3-trace-20251025.md` reports 4/4 acceptance criteria fully covered with automated and manual evidence.
- Test design plan `docs/bmad/qa/assessments/5.3-test-design-20251024.md` executed across all P0 scenarios; telemetry artifact capture instructions satisfied.

## Follow-ups

1. After deploying to staging, capture the required telemetry samples in `docs/bmad/qa/artifacts/5.3/` and attach them to the gate evidence bundle.
2. Schedule the next load/performance sweep with the sanitizer toggle enabled to confirm telemetry write overhead stays negligible (owner: DevOps).
