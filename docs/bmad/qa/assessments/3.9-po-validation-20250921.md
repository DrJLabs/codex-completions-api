## PO Validation

### Template Compliance

- Core template sections (Status, Research Insights, Story, Acceptance Criteria, Tasks/Subtasks, Dev Notes, Testing, Change Log) are present and populated with current references.
- QA Results and Dev Agent Record sections are intentionally absent for this pre-implementation draft; note to add once development completes.
- External citations reference parity spec, LangChain guidance (Sept 2025), and OpenAI streaming announcement—no dangling placeholders observed.

### Critical Issues (Must Fix before GO)

- None. Scope, ACs, and supporting tasks are coherent and align with epic stability/hardening goals.

### Should-Fix / Clarifications

- Resolved: “Update tests and fixtures” task list now includes the LangChain client harness item with explicit STREAM-FIN-06 reference (`docs/bmad/stories/3.9.streaming-finalizer-finish-reason.md`).
- Resolved: Story task list now carries a dedicated telemetry/observability section capturing the finish_reason logging and monitoring work for OBS-3901.

No outstanding clarifications at this time.

### Nice-to-Have Improvements

- Consider noting in Dev Notes which downstream SDK docs (e.g., Vercel AI SDK) need release-note callouts alongside the parity spec update to help the docs owner scope communication faster.

### Acceptance Criteria Coverage

- AC1–AC2 map to the mapper and ordering work; tasks detail capturing upstream `finish_reason`, fallback handling, and preserving finalizer→usage sequence.
- AC3 is supported by the QA risk/test design deliverables (`docs/bmad/qa/assessments/3.9-risk-20250921.md`, `docs/bmad/qa/assessments/3.9-test-design-20250921.md`) and now explicitly calls out STREAM-FIN-06 via the LangChain harness task plus the integration test skeleton (`tests/integration/langchain.streaming.int.test.js`).
- AC4 has dedicated documentation subtasks pointing to the parity spec and release/runbook updates; QA Results section references trace/NFR/gate artefacts confirming delivery.

### Anti-Hallucination / Source Check

- Research citations trace back to internal parity docs and dated external sources; finish_reason behavior and LangChain usage chunks match the referenced September 2025 documentation.
- No speculative claims detected about proto outputs or client contracts beyond cited material.

### Release Readiness

- Development completed 2025-09-22; mapper, telemetry, transcripts, and documentation updates merged with green integration/E2E suites.
- QA gate (`docs/bmad/qa/gates/3.9-streaming-finalizer-richer-finish-reason.yml`) reports PASS with trace + NFR evidence; residual monitoring work tracked via `docs/bmad/issues/2025-09-22-finish-reason-follow-ups.md`.
- Risk profile mitigations (telemetry logging, fixture regeneration plan, LangChain harness ownership) are reflected in the story task list and completed artefacts.

**Decision:** READY FOR RELEASE (GO)

- Implementation Readiness Score: 9/10
- Confidence Level: High — remaining actions are post-release telemetry/dashboard enhancements.

## Summary

- Story 3.9 delivers richer streaming finish_reason parity with supporting QA artefacts and documentation now in place.
- Monitor telemetry dashboard follow-up and enable LangChain harness in CI per the open issue; neither blocks release.
- Hand off to release management with confidence that stop/length scenarios are locked via contracts, transcripts, and telemetry logging.
