## PO Validation

- Template Compliance: PASS — Story maintains the standard structure with completed sections and no placeholders. QA and Dev records reference concrete commands and artifacts.
- Acceptance Criteria: AC1–AC4 map directly to automated coverage listed in the updated trace matrix (`docs/bmad/qa/assessments/5.2-trace-20251024.md`). Toggle-on/off scenarios are exercised via integration + Playwright tests, and the sanitizer-on finish-order assertion closes the previous gap.
- Risks/Dependencies: Residual operational dependency is staged enablement of `PROXY_SANITIZE_METADATA` with monitoring of sanitized key metrics (see QA recommendations and risk profile DATA-001/OPS-001). No additional blockers identified.
- Decision: GO — implementation readiness 9.5/10 with High confidence.

## Validation Report

### Template Compliance Issues

- None.

### Critical Issues (Must Fix)

- None.

### Should-Fix Issues (Important Quality Improvements)

1. Ensure rollout checklist/runbook entries reference the new sanitizer toggle so operators have a single source of truth (mirror Story 5.1 guidance).

### Nice-to-Have Improvements (Optional Enhancements)

1. Capture sanitized vs legacy sample transcripts (link to Playwright artifacts) in Dev Notes for quick stakeholder review.

### Anti-Hallucination Findings

- All statements reference existing artifacts (story, QA assessments, risk profile, integration/Playwright suites). No unsupported claims detected.

### Final Assessment

- Decision: GO
- Implementation Readiness Score: 9.5/10
- Confidence Level: High

## Summary

- Story content, QA artifacts, and risk mitigations are aligned; sanitizer-on ordering assertion resolves prior AC3 concern.
- Next step is operational rollout (staging toggle enablement + monitoring) tracked via QA recommendations.
