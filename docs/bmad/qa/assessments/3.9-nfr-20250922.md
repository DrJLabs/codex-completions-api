## Scope

Evaluate the non-functional impact of propagating richer streaming `finish_reason` metadata, including telemetry logging, new transcripts, and expanded client harness coverage.

## Summary

- **Security — PASS**: No new external surface. Changes are confined to SSE payload content and internal telemetry fields. Normalized reasons are lower-cased strings from trusted upstream metadata; no user-controlled input passes to logs without sanitization.
- **Performance — PASS**: Additional processing is lightweight (string normalization, map lookups). Integration/Playwright timings show no regression (<4s total). Transcript regeneration confirms output volume unchanged aside from metadata.
- **Reliability — PASS**: Parameterized contract tests and regenerated fixtures cover both `stop` and `length` flows. Telemetry now records finish-reason source, improving debugging. Fallback defaults ensure backwards compatibility when metadata is missing.
- **Maintainability — PASS**: Updated parity spec, LangChain harness, and follow-up issue keep documentation and tooling aligned. Logic is centralized in `stream.js`, with helper functions easing future extensions.

Quality Score: 95 (all categories PASS).

## Details & Recommendations

### Security (PASS)

- Normalization strips whitespace and only outputs known enums. No additional headers or env vars added.
- Recommendation: When telemetry dashboards launch, ensure role-based access controls hide request IDs if they appear alongside finish reasons.

### Performance (PASS)

- SSE loop now performs trivial string normalization; profiling during integration tests shows negligible overhead.
- Recommendation: Monitor existing stream latency dashboards after release to confirm no degradation when truncation spikes.

### Reliability (PASS)

- New golden transcript (`streaming-usage-length.json`) and Playwright regression lock in ordering. LangChain harness validates external client expectation once dependency is available.
- Recommendation: Execute LangChain harness in CI when `@langchain/openai` is vendored (tracked in `docs/bmad/issues/2025-09-22-finish-reason-follow-ups.md`).

### Maintainability (PASS)

- Helper functions (`normalizeFinishReason`, `recordFinishReason`) isolate logic. Documentation updates provide canonical guidance for downstream teams.
- Recommendation: Extend `scripts/fake-codex-proto.js` with future provider reasons (e.g., `content_filter`) as soon as upstream schema evolves.

## Follow-up Actions

1. Implement dashboards/alerts leveraging the new telemetry fields to catch unexpected `length` rates (issue `2025-09-22-finish-reason-follow-ups`).
2. Enable the LangChain harness in CI once dependency strategy is finalized.

## Decision

NFR Status: **PASS** — Story 3.9 meets non-functional expectations; proceed with release once follow-up monitoring tasks are planned via the open issue.
