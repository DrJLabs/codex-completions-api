## PO Validation

- Template Compliance: PASS — Story includes Status, Dependencies, Acceptance Criteria, Tasks, Dev Notes, Testing, QA Results, and Change Log sections.
- Acceptance Criteria: Coverage maps AC1–AC6 to engineering tasks and QA plans; new tasks explicitly call out UTF-8 helper, smoke harness artifact workflow, benchmarking, and telemetry instrumentation.
- Risks/Dependencies: Mitigations from Risk Profile (TECH-4201/4202, OPS-4201, PERF-4201, OBS-4201) now appear as discrete tasks with supporting Dev Notes.
- Decision: GO. Implementation readiness scored at 8.5/10 with Medium-High confidence following risk-driven amendments.

## Validation Report

### Template Compliance Issues

- None.

### Critical Issues (Must Fix)

- None identified.

### Should-Fix Issues (Important Quality Improvements)

- None — previously flagged gaps are now represented in the Tasks / Dev Notes sections.

### Nice-to-Have Improvements (Optional Enhancements)

- Consider annotating each Task/Subtask with the Acceptance Criterion it satisfies for faster traceability.
- Define quantitative success metrics (e.g., acceptable out-of-order delta rate, CPU headroom) to accompany the benchmarking task once baselines are recorded.

### Anti-Hallucination Findings

- Assertions verified against Story 4.2 draft, Risk Profile (`docs/bmad/qa/assessments/4.2-risk-20250924.md`), and Test Design (`docs/bmad/qa/assessments/4.2-test-design-20250924.md`). No unsupported claims detected.

### Final Assessment

- Decision: GO
- Implementation Readiness Score: 8.5/10
- Confidence Level: Medium-High — risk mitigations now tracked as explicit work items with supporting guidance.

## Summary

- Reviewed story structure, acceptance criteria, tasks, Dev Notes, testing plan, and linked QA artifacts.
- Confirmed risk-driven tasks now exist for UTF-8 safety, smoke harness workflow, resource benchmarking, and observability.
- QA gate (`docs/bmad/qa/gates/4.2-streaming-tool-call-blocks.yml`) passed on 2025-09-24; awaiting resource benchmarking follow-up prior to production launch.
- Story is ready for development; track Nice-to-Have metrics/traceability improvements opportunistically.
