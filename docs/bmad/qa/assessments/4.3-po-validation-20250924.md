## PO Validation

- Template Compliance: PASS — Story includes required Status, Dependencies, Acceptance Criteria, Tasks, Dev Notes, Testing, QA Results, and Change Log sections.
- Acceptance Criteria: All ACs are now mapped to explicit tasks, including AC4 optional-parameter validation coverage.
- Risks/Dependencies: Story tasks capture risk mitigations for PERF-4301 (benchmarking/guardrails), OBS-4301 (telemetry instrumentation), and BUS-4301 (release communications), reducing unmanaged exposure.
- Decision: GO. Implementation readiness 8.5/10 with Medium-High confidence.

## Validation Report

### Template Compliance Issues

- None.

### Critical Issues (Must Fix)

- None identified.

### Should-Fix Issues (Important Quality Improvements)

- None — prior gaps are now addressed.

### Nice-to-Have Improvements (Optional Enhancements)

- Map each task/subtask to its Acceptance Criterion for easier traceability.
- Note in Dev Notes which upstream transcripts or reference captures will back the multi-choice fixtures to reinforce deterministic data expectations (DATA-4301).

### Anti-Hallucination Findings

- Findings grounded in `docs/bmad/stories/4.3.multi-choice-and-error-lexicon.md`, `docs/bmad/qa/assessments/4.3-risk-20250924.md`, and `docs/bmad/qa/assessments/4.3-test-design-20250924.md`; no unsupported claims detected.

### Final Assessment

- Decision: GO
- Implementation Readiness Score: 8.5/10
- Confidence Level: Medium-High — assumes benchmark data is captured during implementation per new tasks.

## Summary

- Reviewed Story 4.3 alongside its risk profile and test design; structural template compliance is solid.
- Confirmed new tasks cover performance benchmarking, observability instrumentation, release comms, and optional-parameter validation, aligning with risk mitigations.
- Latest integration suite (`npm run test:integration -- chat.nonstream.shape.int.test.js chat.multi-choice.int.test.js chat.contract.streaming.int.test.js error.invalid-n.int.test.js`) passed on 2025-09-24 after dev stack restore, reinforcing readiness.
- Story is ready for development after capturing benchmark evidence during execution and keeping release comms synced with docs.
