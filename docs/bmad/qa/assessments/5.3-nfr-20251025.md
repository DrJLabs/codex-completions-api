## Scope

Evaluate security, performance, reliability, and maintainability impacts of the sanitizer telemetry rollout, including documentation/runbook changes and new QA scripts.

## Summary

- **Security — PASS**: Structured telemetry summarizes sanitized keys/counts without re-emitting raw metadata; integration coverage proves toggle-on paths redact rollout/session values while preserving audit trails.
- **Performance — PASS**: Telemetry logging reuses the existing synchronous NDJSON append pattern; integration runs show no latency regressions and summaries only emit once per sanitized request.
- **Reliability — PASS**: Toggle transitions dedupe repeated writes, logs include route/mode/req identifiers, and disabled paths keep telemetry quiet; failure to write is swallowed to avoid request disruption.
- **Maintainability — PASS**: Helpers centralize telemetry logic with unit tests, docs/runbooks describe the workflow, and QA artifacts/scripts provide repeatable validation guidance.

Quality Score: 100.

## Details & Recommendations

### Security (PASS)

- `logSanitizerSummary` and `logSanitizerToggle` restrict payloads to allowlisted fields (`src/dev-logging.js`), preventing accidental raw metadata leakage.
- Integration suites (`tests/integration/chat.nonstream.metadata.int.test.js`, `tests/integration/chat.stream.metadata.int.test.js`) assert sanitized responses exclude `rollout_path` / `session_id` while telemetry logs only contain summarized keys.
- **Recommendation:** During staging rollout, monitor telemetry samples for unexpected keys to detect upstream schema changes early.

### Performance (PASS)

- Telemetry writes use the same synchronous NDJSON append instrumentation already exercised by usage/proto logging; summaries are emitted once per request plus deduped toggle transitions.
- Targeted Vitest runs (`npx vitest run …metadata.int.test.js`) completed within baseline timing; no additional polling or child processes introduced.
- **Recommendation:** Include sanitizer-on scenarios in the next load/perf sweep to confirm I/O overhead remains minimal under sustained traffic.

### Reliability (PASS)

- Internal state tracks the last toggle value, avoiding repetitive writes and reducing log churn when the flag stays steady.
- Disabled mode path records zero sanitized entries, preserving parity with legacy behavior and simplifying alert conditions.
- **Recommendation:** Add a periodic CI check that tails `SANITIZER_LOG_PATH` in dev stack smoke to ensure telemetry remains writable after deployment packaging changes.

### Maintainability (PASS)

- Telemetry logic lives in `src/dev-logging.js` with targeted unit tests (`tests/unit/dev-logging.sanitizer.spec.js`) and integration coverage, keeping behavior localized.
- Documentation (PRD, architecture) and `docs/private/runbooks/operational.md` now reference the telemetry workflow and QA artifacts, reducing tribal knowledge.
- `scripts/qa/parser-smoke.sh` and `docs/bmad/qa/artifacts/5.3/README.md` codify artifact capture, making future QA reviews repeatable.
- **Recommendation:** Link the parser smoke script in the dev-to-prod playbook during the next update so rollout owners know where to find it.

## Decision

NFR Status: **PASS** — Story 5.3 satisfies the assessed non-functional requirements with clear operational guidance.
