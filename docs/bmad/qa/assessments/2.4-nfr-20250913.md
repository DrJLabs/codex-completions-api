## Summary

- Decision: PASS
- Evidence: `npm run verify:all` green after adding error helper usage, `n>1` and tokens‑exceeded checks, and tests.
- Change validated: streaming error frames normalized to `server_error|timeout_error` and documented.

## Targets & Evidence

- Security — PASS
  - Error messages sanitized; no stack traces or machine paths returned.
  - Auth behavior unchanged (401 + `WWW-Authenticate`); models endpoint remains unprotected only in tests per env flag.
  - Rate limiter and SSE conc guard still active.

- Performance — PASS
  - Validation checks are O(1)/O(n chars) trivial; no extra I/O on happy path.
  - E2E perf smoke remains within thresholds.

- Reliability — PASS
  - Deterministic error mapping; consistent error envelope; stream termination always includes `[DONE]` after error frame.
  - Idle/overall timeouts tested; context‑length guard tested via config toggle.

- Maintainability — PASS
  - Centralized helpers in `src/lib/errors.js`; reduced ad‑hoc JSON construction.
  - Configurable limit `PROXY_MAX_PROMPT_TOKENS` documented via tests.

- Compatibility — PASS
  - Error types align with OpenAI lexicon (`invalid_request_error`, `authentication_error`, `permission_error`, `tokens_exceeded_error`, `rate_limit_error`, `timeout_error`, `server_error`).
  - Docs updated to describe streaming error frame format.

- Observability — PASS
  - Access logs unchanged; usage counters continue to record status 200 paths; consider separate counters per `error.type` (advisory).

## Risks & Notes

- Ensure future handlers also use the centralized helper to avoid drift.
- If permission rules are introduced, wire to `permission_error` helper for consistent mapping.
