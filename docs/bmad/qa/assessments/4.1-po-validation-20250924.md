## PO Validation

- Template Compliance: PASS — Dev Agent Record section restored; all required sections present.
- Acceptance Criteria: Coverage aligns with AC1–AC5; canonical mapping, transcripts, tool-choice behaviour, and documentation tasks are represented.
- Risks/Dependencies: Observability risk OBS-4101 still requires explicit tasking to add canonical finish-reason telemetry. Testing section should reflect newly adopted Playwright/Vitest guidance.
- Decision: GO once Should-Fix items below are incorporated. Implementation readiness scored at 8/10 with Medium confidence.

## Validation Report

### Template Compliance Issues

- None.

### Critical Issues (Must Fix)

- None.

### Should-Fix Issues (Important Quality Improvements)

- Add a task or Dev Note call-out to implement the observability update identified in Risk Profile OBS-4101 (structured logging/metrics for canonical finish reasons) so monitoring expectations are captured in the work plan.
- Update the Testing section to mirror the latest test design guidance: reference diff-based Vitest runs vs. nightly coverage and optional Playwright `trace:"on-first-retry"` / worker fixture toggles so execution expectations stay synchronized.

### Nice-to-Have Improvements (Optional Enhancements)

- Consider annotating tasks with explicit AC references to aid traceability.
- Link the new research brief (`docs/bmad/research/2025-09-24-testing-design-modernization.md`) from Dev Notes to highlight supporting context for testing upgrades.

### Anti-Hallucination Findings

- All technical assertions trace back to referenced docs (story, risk profile, test design, research). No unsupported claims detected.

### Final Assessment

- Decision: GO (pending Should-Fix follow-up)
- Implementation Readiness Score: 8/10
- Confidence Level: Medium — assumes observability and testing updates are documented before development begins.

## Summary

- Reviewed story, epic alignment, architecture references, QA risk/test design, and latest testing research.
- Identified two process-alignment updates to keep the implementation checklist in step with risk mitigations and research outcomes.
- Ready for development once the noted documentation tweaks are applied.
