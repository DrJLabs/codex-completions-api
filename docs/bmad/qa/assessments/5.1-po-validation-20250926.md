## PO Validation

- Template Compliance: PASS — Story follows the standard structure (Status → Story → Acceptance Criteria → Tasks → Dev Notes → Testing → Dev Agent Record → Change Log → QA Results) with no placeholder text remaining.
- Acceptance Criteria: AC1–AC4 line up with test artifacts referenced in QA trace (`docs/bmad/qa/assessments/5.1-trace-20250926.md`) and the new integration/unit suites. Each AC is tied to at least one task and corresponding verification.
- Risks/Dependencies: Rollout sequencing depends on staged enablement of `PROXY_SANITIZE_METADATA` and continued monitoring for new metadata keys (see Risk Profile DATA-5101/OPS-5102). Dev Notes capture the helper reuse expectation; recommend tracking the streaming follow-up as a subsequent story.
- Decision: GO — implementation readiness scored at 9/10 with High confidence.

## Validation Report

### Template Compliance Issues

- None.

### Critical Issues (Must Fix)

- None.

### Should-Fix Issues (Important Quality Improvements)

1. Add an explicit reference in Dev Notes or Tasks to create a follow-up story for streaming sanitization parity so the dependency is formally captured in the backlog.

### Nice-to-Have Improvements (Optional Enhancements)

1. Expand Testing section with the exact Vitest/Integration command pair already executed (`npm run test:unit`, `npm run test:integration -- chat.nonstream.metadata.int.test.js`) for quick copy/paste.
2. Consider linking the rollout checklist/runbook section once updated (`docs/bmad/prd.md` observability reference) to centralize operator guidance.

### Anti-Hallucination Findings

- All technical statements derive from referenced documents (story, PRD, architecture, risk/test design artifacts). No unsupported claims detected.

### Final Assessment

- Decision: GO
- Implementation Readiness Score: 9/10
- Confidence Level: High

## Summary

- Story is implementation-ready with clear toggle behavior, testing expectations, and QA coverage.
- Primary follow-up is documenting/planning the streaming sanitizer parity work so roadmap items stay aligned.
- Recommend proceeding to development once the follow-up action is scheduled.
