## Summary

- Decision: PASS
- Quality score: 90 (CONCERNS: 1 — observability assertions)
- Evidence: Integration (22 passed, 2 skipped), E2E (9 passed); perf smoke TTFC p95 < 2s, total p95 < 5s.

## Targets & Evidence

- Security
  - Bearer auth enforced on chat/completions handlers; `WWW-Authenticate` on 401.
  - App-level rate limit middleware present; SSE concurrency guard active.
  - Child env is whitelisted via `CODEX_HOME` and controlled `cwd`; no new secret surfaces in services.
  - Status: PASS

- Performance
  - Perf smoke thresholds (TTFC p95 < 2000ms; total p95 < 5000ms) remain satisfied post‑refactor.
  - Services introduce no measurable overhead in tests; SSE keepalive cadence unchanged by default.
  - Status: PASS

- Reliability
  - Timeouts honored: `PROXY_TIMEOUT_MS`, `PROXY_STREAM_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS`, `PROXY_PROTO_IDLE_MS` (non‑stream), `PROXY_KILL_ON_DISCONNECT`.
  - SSE termination invariant preserved: role‑first delta, stable id, `[DONE]`.
  - Status: PASS

- Maintainability
  - Spawn and SSE concerns centralized under `src/services/`; handlers simplified.
  - Interfaces minimal; shared helpers reduce duplication and future drift.
  - Status: PASS

- Compatibility
  - External API shapes unchanged (OpenAI‑compatible chat + legacy completions shim).
  - Headers for preflight/HEAD/POST unchanged.
  - Status: PASS

- Observability
  - Structured access log middleware unchanged; proto/dev logging intact.
  - Note: No explicit assertion on access‑log field values in tests (non‑blocking for this story).
  - Status: CONCERNS (minor)

## Risks & Mitigations (from risk profile)

- OPS-001 (keepalive heuristics): Mitigated by unit/integration scenarios; retained UA/header/query switches in `computeKeepaliveMs`.
- TECH-001/002 (service interface drift, error/usage parity): Integration/E2E parity checks; golden response comparisons planned.

    notes: "OpenAI shapes unchanged; legacy shim parity"
  observability:

    notes: "No explicit assertions for structured access‑log fields"
```

## Recommendations

1. Add a lightweight integration check that asserts presence of structured access‑log fields (`req_id`, route, status, duration).
2. Capture a golden sample for non‑stream JSON envelope and SSE chunk sequence to pin parity long‑term.
