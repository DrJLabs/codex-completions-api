## Checklist Summary

- Acceptance Criteria are clear, testable, and map to implementation: YES
- Scope boundaries defined (errors out of scope; handled in 2.4): YES
- Dependencies acknowledged (2.4 complete): YES
- Tasks enumerate tests and doc updates: YES
- Definition of Done ties to CI and verify: YES

## Notes

- AC‑3 (model consistency) explicitly states equality between streaming and non‑streaming paths — good clarity.
- Suggest linking specific test filenames in the story to reduce drift (added under Tasks in story).
- No product copy/docs changes required beyond parity note; spec remains the same.

## Decision

Validated. Ready for implementation and QA per Test Design.
