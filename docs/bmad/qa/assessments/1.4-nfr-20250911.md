# NFR Assessment — Story 1.4: Phase 3 Chat Handlers Extraction

Date: 2025-09-11
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Summary

- Assessed: Security, Performance, Reliability, Maintainability
- Status: SECURITY: CONCERNS, PERFORMANCE: CONCERNS, RELIABILITY: PASS, MAINTAINABILITY: PASS
- Quality Score: 80/100

## Security — CONCERNS

Evidence

- Bearer auth enforced on `/v1/chat/completions` and `/v1/completions`; 401 envelope + `WWW-Authenticate` header present.
- CORS behavior preserved; Authorization header allowed; preflight handled.

Gaps / Risks

- No application-level rate limiting on protected routes (rely on Traefik/Cloudflare today).
- No explicit abuse controls for long‑lived SSE connections beyond idle timeouts.

Recommendations (Must‑fix or Edge)

- Short‑term: Document reliance on edge rate limiting; add advisory limits in Traefik/Cloudflare configs.
- Optional: Add lightweight app‑level rate limiter with per‑IP burst/bucket for chat endpoints.

## Performance — CONCERNS (Targets Undefined)

Evidence

- Router/handler extraction expected to be neutral; no heavy synchronous work added.
- Stream path already emits incremental deltas; keepalives configurable via `PROXY_SSE_KEEPALIVE_MS`.

Gaps

- No explicit performance targets for non‑stream p95 or stream TTFC in PRD.
- No automated perf smoke for chat endpoints.

Recommendations

- Define targets (suggested): non‑stream p95 ≤ 2000 ms; stream TTFC p95 ≤ 1500 ms; keepalive ≤ 15 s.
- Add optional `autocannon` perf smoke to CI for `/v1/chat/completions` (non‑stream) with small concurrency.

## Reliability — PASS

Evidence

- Timeouts present: `PROXY_TIMEOUT_MS`, `PROXY_STREAM_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS`, `PROXY_PROTO_IDLE_MS`.
- SSE termination contract preserved (`[DONE]`); keepalive toggles by UA/header/query.
- Optional `PROXY_KILL_ON_DISCONNECT` to terminate child on client drop.

Risks

- Ensure all timers/intervals are cleared on `close/finish/aborted` after extraction.

Recommendations

- Add a focused test to assert timer cleanup on disconnect (integration with stub backend).

## Maintainability — PASS

Evidence

- Clear separation: `src/routes/chat.js`, `src/handlers/chat/{stream,nonstream}.js` planned.
- Reduced `server.js` surface; reuse shared helpers for model normalization and error envelopes.
- Test design and trace produced; risk profile documented.

Risks

- Temporary duplication of logging until a later consolidation phase.

Recommendations

- After extraction, consolidate logging into a single JSON access log; keep text log only if needed for ops.
