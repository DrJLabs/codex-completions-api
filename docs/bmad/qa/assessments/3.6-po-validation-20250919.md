## PO Validation

### Template Compliance

- All template sections (Status, Story, Acceptance Criteria, Tasks/Subtasks, Dev Notes, Testing, QA Results, Dev Agent Record, Change Log) are present and populated where expected for a draft.
- No placeholder strings remain; citations reference current Keploy 3.0 and GitHub Actions guidance.

### Critical Issues (Must Fix before GO)

- None. Story contains actionable ACs, tasks, and architecture-backed Dev Notes.

### Should-Fix / Clarifications

- Add QA trace and NFR assessments once development completes to maintain parity with prior stories (tracked as follow-up; not blocking draft approval).

### Nice-to-Have Improvements

- Consider attaching an example `keploy.yml` snippet in supporting docs during implementation for quicker onboarding.

### Acceptance Criteria Coverage

- AC1–AC6 map directly to task groups with explicit references to architecture docs and external research. Tasks note AC tags and identify deliverables (`keploy.yml`, CI workflow updates, sanitization rules, documentation refresh), providing clear definition of done.
- Testing section aligns with planned Vitest/Playwright suites and the forthcoming Keploy-backed pipeline checks.

### Anti-Hallucination / Source Check

- All technical claims cite internal architecture docs or the newly collected Keploy/GitHub Actions references; no invented tooling or unsupported approaches detected.

### Implementation Readiness

- Dev Notes summarize prior Story 3.5 artifacts, target file locations, configuration knobs, and CI expectations; combined with QA risk + test design docs (`docs/bmad/qa/assessments/3.6-risk-20250919.md`, `docs/bmad/qa/assessments/3.6-test-design-20250919.md`) they provide sufficient context for the dev agent.

**Decision:** READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION (GO)

- Implementation Readiness Score: 8/10
- Confidence Level: Medium-High — remaining uncertainty centers on Keploy proxy behaviour, already mitigated through dedicated risk/test plans.

## Summary

- Story 3.6 is structurally complete and grounded in epic/architecture requirements; no blockers identified.
- QA risk profile and test design are in place; gate file to be produced post-implementation.
- Recommend proceeding with development while ensuring `keploy.yml` and CI artifacts are committed alongside code changes.
