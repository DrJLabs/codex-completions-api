# QA Review Summary

- Scope validated against story ACs.
- Evidence shows dev edge non‑stream returns HTTP 200 JSON under 60 s; streaming remains 200 with finish‑reason and `[DONE]`.
- Cloudflare rule corrected to `/v1/chat/completions` (dev cache ruleset).
- Dev‑only early finalize guard added (finish_reason:"length").

## Decision

PASS — with notes

- Contract preserved; clients receive valid envelopes.
- Content may contain upstream errors if provider rejects minimal model; acceptable for DEV only.

## Follow‑ups

- Add edge smoke to CI post‑deploy for dev.
- Consider shorter guard (45 s) if necessary.
