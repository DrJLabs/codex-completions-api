## Summary

Scope introduces nullable placeholders in the final streaming usage chunk when `include_usage:true`. Non‑stream path unchanged. Tests and docs updated. No functional regressions observed in E2E.

## Evidence

- Risk Profile: docs/bmad/qa/assessments/2.6-risk-20250914.md (highest TECH‑001 score 4; must‑fix: gating correctness — covered by tests)
- Test Design: docs/bmad/qa/assessments/2.6-test-design-20250914.md (8 scenarios; P0=2)
- Trace Matrix: docs/bmad/qa/assessments/2.6-trace-20250914.md (coverage: FULL)
- NFR: docs/bmad/qa/assessments/2.6-nfr-20250914.md (PASS)
- Parity Spec: docs/openai-chat-completions-parity.md (updated 2025‑09‑14)

## Findings

- Streaming usage chunk includes placeholders only when requested; E2E confirms presence and null values.
- Non‑stream usage fields unchanged; integration test confirms absence of placeholders.
- Ordering invariant preserved; finalizer precedes usage; stream ends with `[DONE]`.
- Known unrelated flake tracked: docs/bmad/issues/2025-09-14-nonstream-length-flake.md.

## Decision

QA Review: PASS with note on unrelated flake.
