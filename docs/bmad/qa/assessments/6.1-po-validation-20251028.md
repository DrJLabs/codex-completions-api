## PO Validation

- Template Compliance: PASS — Story 6.1 now contains finalized QA results, PASS gate reference, and explicit transcript regeneration instructions with no placeholders remaining.
- Acceptance Criteria: AC1–AC4 confirmed via trace matrix ([`epic-responses-endpoint-parity.6.1-trace-20251026.md`](./epic-responses-endpoint-parity.6.1-trace-20251026.md)). Integration and Playwright suites cover non-stream/stream parity, metadata sanitization toggles, concurrency guard behavior, and the new `include_usage` default regression (`tests/integration/responses.stream.tool-delta.int.test.js`).
- Risks/Dependencies: QA gate reports zero outstanding risks; remaining follow-up is operational (capture production transcripts once Codex binaries are available) and tracked in story recommendations.
- Decision: GO — implementation ready 9.4/10 with High confidence.

## Validation Report

### Template Compliance Issues

- None.

### Critical Issues (Must Fix)

- None.

### Should-Fix Issues (Important Quality Improvements)

- None.

### Nice-to-Have Improvements (Optional Enhancements)

1. When production Codex access opens, run `node scripts/generate-responses-transcripts.mjs --codex /path/to/codex` to capture live transcripts for the rollout package.

### Anti-Hallucination Findings

- Statements cross-reference the QA trace, gate, and test files listed above. No unsupported claims identified.

### Final Assessment

- Decision: GO
- Implementation Readiness Score: 9.4/10
- Confidence Level: High

## Summary

- `/v1/responses` handlers and shared utilities satisfy parity requirements with `/v1/chat/completions`, including typed SSE events, metadata sanitization toggles, and default usage behavior.
- QA gate is PASS with no remaining risks; deploy readiness depends only on capturing live Codex transcripts once available.
