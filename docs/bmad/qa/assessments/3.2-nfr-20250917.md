# NFR Assessment (Core Four)

## Summary

- Security: PASS — Auth flow unchanged; integration suite still enforces Bearer requirements; docs confirm no new externals.
- Performance: PASS — Non-stream responses return immediately after proto exit; dev-edge smoke shows sub-second turnaround with usage present.
- Reliability: PASS — Five-run truncation integration test and Playwright suite confirm deterministic behavior with stable `[DONE]` ordering.
- Maintainability: PASS — Code localized to handler/test, documentation updated (runbook + issue), and full verify pipeline executed.
- Quality Score: 100

## Details

### Security — PASS

- Authentication remains Bearer-only; `postChatNonStream` still checks API key before execution.
- Integration tests (`tests/integration/error.param.int.test.js`, `tests/integration/routes.models.int.test.js`) continue to assert auth gates; no new headers exposed.
- Usage logging still sanitized; respondWithJson helper avoids leaking secrets on failure.

### Performance — PASS

- Handler now finalizes immediately on proto termination, reducing idle timeout waits.
- Dev-edge smoke (2025-09-17) returned HTTP 200 with minimal latency for both non-stream and streaming paths.
- No additional buffering introduced; idle watchdog cancels after completion.

### Reliability — PASS

- New deterministic finalization ensures socket close does not drop JSON; integration test runs five sequential requests without failure.
- Playwright SSE suite (`npm test`) confirms streaming behavior unaffected (finish_reason → usage → [DONE]).
- Idle timeout guard still present with cancel/kill safety.

### Maintainability — PASS

- Changes confined to `src/handlers/chat/nonstream.js` with helper extraction; tests added for regression.
- Runbook and issue updated with triage guidance; PO validation recorded for dependent story.
- Full pipeline (`npx prettier -c .`, `npm run lint`, `npm run test:unit`, `npm run test:integration`, `npm test`) executed successfully.
