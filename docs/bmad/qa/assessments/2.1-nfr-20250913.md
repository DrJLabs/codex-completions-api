## Scope

Evaluate non‑functional aspects introduced or affected by the Chat Completions parity spec and tests: security, performance, reliability, observability, compatibility, and maintainability.

## Security

- Objective: No secrets in examples; no expansion of attack surface; auth unchanged.
- Evidence: Goldens use placeholders; error envelope keeps `param` minimal; auth unchanged (401 on missing/invalid token).
- Decision: PASS

## Performance

- Objective: Keep streaming TTFC and total latency within generous CI thresholds; no regressions in non‑stream.
- Evidence: E2E perf smoke enforces p95 TTFC < 2s, total < 5s (tests/e2e/perf-smoke.spec.ts).
- Decision: PASS (monitor; keep thresholds stable unless justified)

## Reliability

- Objective: Stable SSE (keepalives optional), finalizer chunk ordering, idle timeouts honored.
- Evidence: Stream handler now emits explicit finish_reason chunk before `[DONE]`; idle/timeout integration tests remain green.
- Decision: PASS

## Observability

- Objective: Structured access logs intact; usage telemetry recorded for stream/non‑stream.
- Evidence: Integration access‑log test passes; appendUsage captured on both paths.
- Decision: PASS

## Compatibility

- Objective: OpenAI client shape parity (non‑stream object/fields; streaming order; optional usage chunk); React SSE guidance updated.
- Evidence: Spec doc + goldens; E2E cover role‑first, stable id, usage chunk before `[DONE]`, and finish_reason finalizer; checklist updated.
- Decision: PASS

## Maintainability

- Objective: Versioned spec; examples co‑change; tests document contract.
- Evidence: Spec v0.1 with date; goldens checked in; story File List maintained.
- Decision: PASS

## Conclusion

- Decision: PASS (no NFR blockers)
- Follow‑ups (advisory):
  - Keep perf smoke in CI; alert on >5–10% drift sustained over several runs.
  - If future features add tool_calls or logprobs, extend spec and tests accordingly.
