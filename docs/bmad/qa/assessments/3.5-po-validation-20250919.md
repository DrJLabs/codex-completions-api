## PO Validation

- Alignment: Story delivers the parity guardrail called out in Epic Stability Phase 5 by codifying golden transcripts and contract checks for `/v1/chat/completions`.
- Acceptance Criteria: AC1–AC4 verified via newly committed transcripts, Vitest/Playwright suites, and documentation updates; QA artifacts (risk, test design, trace, NFR) confirm full coverage.
- Risks/Dependencies: Follow-up issue `docs/bmad/issues/2025-09-19-keploy-snapshot-ci.md` tracks Keploy rollout but does not block delivery; gate decision PASS.
- Decision: APPROVED

## Summary

- Reviewed Dev Notes, QA outputs (risk, test design, trace, NFR), and gate file `docs/bmad/qa/gates/3.5-golden-transcripts-contract-checks.yml` — all green.
- Verified tasks and transcripts exist; `npm run verify:all` derivatives executed (unit, integration, Playwright contract spec).
- No additional acceptance criteria required prior to merge; proceed with follow-up issue for Keploy integration.
