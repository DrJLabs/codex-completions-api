## Validation Summary

Story implements the required streaming parity: finalizer with finish_reason, optional usage chunk gating, stable id/created, and updated docs. Tests cover ordering and negative/edge paths.

## Acceptance Criteria Check

- Finish‑reason chunk before `[DONE]`: Met (tests pass).
- Intermediate chunks carry `finish_reason:null` and `usage:null`: Met.
- Usage chunk gated and positioned correctly: Met.
- Non‑stream unchanged with `finish_reason` populated: Met.
- Tests/docs updated: Met.

## Decision

- Status: APPROVED for merge once code review completes.

## Notes

- Recommend adding changelog entries for client integrators highlighting finish_reason → usage → [DONE] ordering.
