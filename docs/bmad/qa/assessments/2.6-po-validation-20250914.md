## Validation Summary

Story 2.6 introduces nullable latency placeholders in the final streaming usage chunk when usage is requested. Scope is intentionally minimal and isolated to the streaming usage chunk; non‑stream remains unchanged. This supports forward‑compatible client contracts without functional impact today.

## Acceptance Criteria Check

- Placeholders present only on final usage chunk when `include_usage:true`: CLEAR & TESTABLE.
- Non‑stream unchanged (no new fields): CLEAR & TESTABLE.
- SSE ordering preserved (finish‑reason precedes usage; `[DONE]` last): CLEAR & TESTABLE.
- Backward compatibility when usage not requested (no usage chunk): CLEAR & TESTABLE.
- Docs updated to note placeholders and nullability: CLEAR & ACTIONABLE.

## Structure & Template Conformance

- Required sections present and match project story template: PASS.
- Tasks/DoD specify tests and doc updates: PASS.

## Decision

APPROVED for development. Proceed after adding/validating the E2E and integration tests listed in Test Design.

## Notes

- Keep placeholders restricted to streaming usage chunk only; avoid expanding scope to non‑stream until metrics are ready to populate.
- Ensure doc examples clearly show `null` values to prevent misinterpretation by clients and dashboards.
