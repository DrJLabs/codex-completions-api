# PO Validation

- AC1–AC4 satisfied with QA evidence: deterministic truncation, regression guard, documentation updates, and verify pipeline.
- Dev edge smoke outputs attached via `/tmp/nonstream.out` and `/tmp/stream.out` logs; parity confirmed.
- Residual risk downgraded to medium/low with monitoring recommendations only.

Decision: Approved — move story to Done when merged.
