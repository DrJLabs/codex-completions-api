## Final PO Validation

### Story Artifact Check

- Status, Acceptance Criteria, Tasks/Subtasks, Dev Notes, Testing, Dev Agent Record, QA Results, Change Log updated through version 0.2.
- DoD checklist appended with 2025-09-20 review; story marked Ready for Review.
- Traceability (`docs/bmad/qa/assessments/3.6-trace-20250920.md`) and NFR assessment (`docs/bmad/qa/assessments/3.6-nfr-20250920.md`) linked from gate file.

### Acceptance Criteria Review

- AC1, AC4, AC6 flagged as partially satisfied pending Keploy rollout ticket (`docs/bmad/issues/2025-09-20-keploy-install-config.md`).
- Remaining criteria satisfied via committed artifacts (transcript generator toggle, YAML snapshots, documentation updates).

### Gate & QA Alignment

- Gate `docs/bmad/qa/gates/3.6-keploy-snapshot-ci-integration.yml` set to CONCERNS with quality score 80; acceptable to proceed with PR while follow-up ticket is open.
- QA DoD and test results attached; `npm run test:all` executed on 2025-09-20.

### Outstanding Items / Follow-ups

- Execute follow-up ticket before enabling `KEPLOY_ENABLED` in CI.
- Monitor Keploy replay duration once rollout is complete.

### Decision

- ✅ Ready for PR merge review with explicit note that Keploy installation ticket must land before flag activation.
- Confidence: High — residual risk isolated to deployment of CLI (tracked separately).

## Summary for Reviewers

- Story artifacts complete; CI toggles default-safe.
- Partial ACs and NFR concerns documented and tied to dedicated issue.
- Recommend merging changes alongside follow-up plan.
