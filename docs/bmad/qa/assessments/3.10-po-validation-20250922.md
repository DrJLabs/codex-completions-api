## PO Validation

### Template Compliance

- All core sections (Status, Research Insights, Story, Acceptance Criteria, Tasks/Subtasks, Dev Notes, Testing, Change Log) are complete and current.
- Research citations reference internal issue/epic docs plus dated external sources (GitHub release guidance, Actions artifact digests, Backblaze 3-2-1, Google Drive mount observation). No placeholder text remains.
- QA artefacts (risk profile and test design) exist at `docs/bmad/qa/assessments/3.10-risk-20250922.md` and `docs/bmad/qa/assessments/3.10-test-design-20250922.md`, satisfying QA collaboration expectations.

### Critical Issues (Must Fix before GO)

- None. Scope and ACs align with solo-maintainer goals and Epic 3 hardening priorities.

### Should-Fix / Clarifications

- Resolved: Dev Notes now document the default `/mnt/gdrive/codex-backups/YYYY/MM-DD/` layout and point to `.env.dev`/`CODEX_BACKUP_GPG_KEY` for optional encryption keys.

### Nice-to-Have Improvements

- Optional: capture the first automation follow-up (scheduled dry-run backup) once the maintainer has capacity; Story trace references the recommendation.

### Acceptance Criteria Coverage

- AC1: Snapshot tooling updates captured via specific `scripts/stack-snapshot.sh` tasks (dry-run, keep-count) and minimal lock-file schema guidance.
- AC2: Release workflow tasks specify digest logging and manual fallback instructions; Testing section mandates digest verification. citeturn0search1turn0search7
- AC3: Retention policy addressed by prune tasks and doc updates.
- AC4: Backup tasks cover Google Drive copy, checksum, mount checks, and optional secondary targets; QA risk/test plans reinforce restore cadence. citeturn1search7turn1search0
- AC5: Docs & comms tasks clearly point to runbook, playbook, README updates and release checklist addition.

### Anti-Hallucination / Source Check

- External references drawn from current GitHub documentation (artifact digests) and mainstream backup guidance; testing cadence citations align with small-team best practices.
- Google Drive mount validation documented via `df -h` output dated 2025-09-22.

**Decision:** APPROVED — Story 3.10 meets PO expectations and may proceed to release readiness tasks alongside QA sign-off (trace, NFR, gate PASS).
