## Scope

Evaluate security, performance, reliability, and maintainability impacts of enabling metadata sanitization for streaming chat completions behind `PROXY_SANITIZE_METADATA` while preserving observability and SSE contract guarantees.

## Summary

- **Security — PASS**: Telemetry-only metadata is stripped from streamed deltas when the toggle is enabled; sanitized keys and sources are logged for audit parity with non-stream.
- **Performance — PASS**: Sanitization reuses bounded string processing from the non-stream path; integration and Playwright runs show no latency regression.
- **Reliability — PASS**: Toggle defaults to `false`, usage logs capture sanitizer status, and tests now assert finish-order semantics with the sanitizer enabled alongside baseline contract coverage.
- **Maintainability — PASS**: Shared helper and logging patterns minimize duplication; docs and config samples document the toggle.

Quality Score: 100.

## Details & Recommendations

### Security (PASS)

- Sanitizer removes rollout telemetry (`rollout_path`, `session_id`) from streamed content while appending a `metadata_sanitizer_summary` proto event (`src/handlers/chat/stream.js`).
- Usage NDJSON records `metadata_sanitizer_enabled`, sanitized key counts, and sources (`tests/integration/chat.stream.metadata.int.test.js`).
- **Recommendation:** During staged rollout, monitor sanitized keys for unexpected values to detect upstream schema changes early.

### Performance (PASS)

- Sanitizer operations are linear over each chunk and reuse the existing helper (`src/lib/metadata-sanitizer.js`); no additional I/O or child processes introduced.
- Integration suite (`npm run test:integration -- chat.stream.metadata.int.test.js`) and Playwright streaming E2E (`npm test -- chat-stream-metadata`) completed within baseline timings, indicating negligible overhead.
- **Recommendation:** Include sanitizer-on scenarios in the next load/perf sweep to validate under sustained traffic.

### Reliability (PASS)

- Toggle remains default-off, preserving rollback capability; usage logging plus proto summaries provide observability if sanitization misbehaves.
- Contract coverage stays green (`tests/integration/chat.contract.streaming.int.test.js`), and the updated integration suite asserts finish reason → optional usage → `[DONE]` ordering with `PROXY_SANITIZE_METADATA=true`.
- **Recommendation:** Maintain the sanitizer-on ordering assertion in future refactors to guard against regressions.

### Maintainability (PASS)

- Streaming handler delegates sanitization to existing helper functions, avoiding duplicate logic and aligning with Story 5.1 patterns.
- `.env.example` and `docker-compose.local.example.yml` document the toggle, guiding operators.
- Tests live alongside existing suites, keeping coverage discoverable and CI-friendly.
- **Recommendation:** Future stories should consolidate shared sanitizer logging expectations into a doc snippet (e.g., README QA section) to reduce repeated guidance.

## Decision

NFR Status: **PASS** — Story 5.2 satisfies assessed non-functional requirements with all targeted mitigations in place.
