## Summary

Story 5.3 introduces structured sanitizer telemetry, documentation updates, and runbook guidance required for the `PROXY_SANITIZE_METADATA` rollout. The highest risks concentrate on ensuring telemetry is accurate without leaking metadata and that operational documentation keeps pace. Two high risks (score 6) remain until tests and reviews confirm the implementation, leaving an overall story risk score of 73 (medium risk envelope).

## Risk Register Details

- **TECH-001** — Mitigate by reusing established sanitizer helper APIs and writing dedicated unit coverage on the telemetry formatter. Integration tests should consume fake Codex outputs with metadata events to confirm structured fields (`sanitized_metadata_count`, `sanitized_metadata_keys`, toggle state flags).
- **DATA-001** — Require negative assertions that sanitized summaries never echo raw telemetry fields. Include regression tests that feed path-like values to ensure they remain redacted. During rollout, capture log snippets and store in QA artifacts.
- **OPS-001** — Bundle documentation updates with code changes and route through PO review. Maintain cross-links between PRD, architecture, and runbooks.
- **PERF-001** — Monitor log volume counters post-deploy; the feature flag allows quick disablement if telemetry overhead spikes.

## Risk-Based Recommendations

### Testing Focus

1. Prioritize P0 unit and integration tests that validate sanitizer telemetry payloads (mitigates TECH-001, DATA-001).
2. Capture log snapshots in staging as part of QA artifacts to provide evidence that no raw metadata leaks (mitigates DATA-001).
3. Ensure documentation updates undergo PO/QA review to confirm runbooks reflect toggle workflows (mitigates OPS-001).

### Development Focus

- Keep telemetry generation inside existing helpers to centralize redaction.
- Guard loggers with explicit schemas (e.g., allowlisted keys) to reduce accidental payload drift.
- Treat documentation updates as acceptance criteria—block merges until PRD/architecture/runbooks align.

### Deployment & Monitoring

- During canary, enable `PROXY_SANITIZE_METADATA=true` and stream logs to confirm telemetry events match expectations (counts, keys, toggle events).
- Configure alerts on sanitized metadata count drop-to-zero or spike anomalies to detect regressions quickly.
- Retain fallback plan: disable toggle or revert telemetry commit if log volume or content deviates.

### Residual Risks

Residual exposure remains if manual log review is skipped; mandate QA attachment of sanitized log samples before closing the story. Performance risk is minor but should be reassessed if logging expands.
