## Template Compliance

- All sections from the story template are present (Status, Research Insights, Story, Acceptance Criteria, Tasks/Subtasks, Dev Notes, Testing, QA Results, Dev Agent Record, Change Log).
- No leftover handlebars or `_TBD_` placeholders detected.
- Checklist formatting matches template expectations (checkboxes with AC references).

## Acceptance Criteria Review

- AC1–AC4 trace cleanly to tasks and testing guidance. Loopback-only validation is captured in AC1/Tasks (installer helper + binding checks).
- Trace and NFR artefacts (`docs/bmad/qa/assessments/3.7-trace-20250920.md`, `docs/bmad/qa/assessments/3.7-nfr-20250920.md`) reflect current coverage: AC1/AC3 partial pending rollout evidence; security/maintainability pass.
- Testing section enumerates commands that satisfy AC3 (dry-run) and AC4 (documentation evidence), aligning with QA Test Design scenarios.
- Edge cases: DNS helper port (26789) called out in research/testing baseline; consider noting optional disablement or loopback binding in Dev Notes for completeness (already implied in QA artefacts).

## Tasks & Sequencing

- Tasks cover install helper, documentation updates, CI rehearsal, and rollout decision artefacts with AC references.
- Sequencing follows expected rollout order (install → document → CI dry-run → decision). No blocking dependencies found.

## Testing Instructions

- Testing section mirrors QA Test Design (verify:all with Keploy + runtime delta capture, `keploy test`, optional `keploy record`, transcript regeneration).
- Performance budget guard now explicitly covered via runtime delta note.

## Anti-Hallucination & Source Integrity

- Research Insights and Dev Notes cite authoritative Keploy docs and internal architecture pages, including the Keploy testing guide for default port expectations.
- No invented tooling references identified.

## Final Assessment

- **GO** — Story is ready for implementation.
- **Implementation Readiness Score:** 9 / 10
- **Confidence Level:** High

## Follow-up Actions

1. Optional: note DNS helper port handling (`dnsPort: 0` or loopback binding) for clarity when devs configure local runs.
2. Monitor execution evidence once the rollout work begins; update QA gate with traceability artefacts.

## Summary for Reviewers

- Story is structurally complete, aligned with QA artefacts, and documents loopback-only rollout expectations.
- Ready for developer handoff once optional DNS helper clarification is confirmed.
