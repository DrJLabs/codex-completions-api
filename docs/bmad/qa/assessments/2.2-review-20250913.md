## Summary

Scope delivered as specified: streaming emits finish_reason chunk, then optional usage chunk, then [DONE]; intermediate chunks have finish_reason:null and usage:null; id/created stable. Tests and docs updated.

## Evidence

- verify:all (2025-09-13): Unit 17/17, Integration 25/25 (2 skipped), E2E 13/13.
- New tests: created stability, intermediate nulls, negative usage path.
- Spec and checklist reflect final ordering and semantics.

## Decision

- Gate: PASS (see gate file docs/bmad/qa/gates/2.2-phase-b-streaming-finish-reason.yml)

## Notes

- Consider adding a golden NDJSON transcript refresh in 2.1 to mirror explicit finish_reason chunk.
