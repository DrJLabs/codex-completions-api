# QA Review Summary

- Re-verified AC1–AC4 after sanitizer-on finish-order assertions landed in `tests/integration/chat.stream.metadata.int.test.js`; integration, Playwright (`tests/e2e/chat-stream-metadata.spec.ts`), and helper unit coverage (`tests/unit/metadata-sanitizer.spec.js`) all green with toggle-on/off behavior validated.
- Inspected `src/handlers/chat/stream.js` changes to confirm sanitizer hooks only intercept Codex metadata events while leaving tool/function deltas, finish reason, usage, and `[DONE]` emissions untouched; ordering assertion now enforces this.
- Reviewed configuration/docs updates (`.env.example`, `docker-compose.local.example.yml`, story notes) for operator guidance; parity with Story 5.1 maintained.
- Cross-referenced risk profile (`docs/bmad/qa/assessments/5.2-risk-20251024.md`) — TECH-001/OPS-001 mitigations remain effective; AC3 gap resolved by new integration assertion.
- Compared transcripts/artifacts in `test-results/` (Playwright) to ensure sanitized runs drop telemetry without truncating legitimate assistant text (path-like examples remain intact).

## Decision

PASS — ready for PO validation

- Acceptance criteria satisfied with automated coverage; telemetry redaction gated by feature flag and observability retained via usage/proto logging.
- Sanitizer-on finish-order assertion closes previous residual risk; no outstanding QA issues remain.

## Evidence Reviewed

| Category    | Evidence |
| ----------- | -------- |
| Unit        | `npm run test:unit` (includes `tests/unit/metadata-sanitizer.spec.js` parity scenarios) |
| Integration | `npm run test:integration -- chat.stream.metadata.int.test.js` (toggle on/off, sanitizer-on ordering assertion) |
| E2E         | `npm test -- chat-stream-metadata.spec.ts` (Playwright streaming sanitizer toggle) |
| Code        | `src/handlers/chat/stream.js`, `src/lib/metadata-sanitizer.js`, `.env.example`, `docker-compose.local.example.yml` |
| Docs        | `docs/bmad/stories/5.2.streaming-metadata-sanitizer.md`, `docs/bmad/qa/assessments/5.2-test-design-20251024.md`, `docs/bmad/qa/assessments/5.2-risk-20251024.md` |

## Traceability

- Trace matrix `docs/bmad/qa/assessments/5.2-trace-20251024.md` now shows 4/4 ACs fully covered with sanitizer-on ordering assertions in place.
- Test design plan `docs/bmad/qa/assessments/5.2-test-design-20251024.md` executed completely (7/7 scenarios run across unit/integration/E2E).

## Follow-ups

1. Once deployed, enable the toggle in staging and monitor sanitized key metrics to validate telemetry parity before production rollout (owner: DevOps).
