# QA Review Summary

- Scope validated against AC1–AC6 using refreshed transcripts (parallel + sequential tool-call paths) and the shared tool-call aggregator.
- Unit, integration, and Playwright suites now assert incremental `delta.tool_calls`, final aggregates, usage emission, and sequential fallback handling.
- Solo-dev smoke harness (`scripts/smoke/stream-tool-call.js --include-usage`) captures raw SSE logs + hashes in `docs/bmad/qa/artifacts/streaming-tool-call/` for diffable evidence.
- Documentation updates (`docs/openai-chat-completions-parity.md`) describe streamed tool-call structure, capability flags, and solo smoke workflow.
- Resource benchmarking (usage buffering on/off) shows ~0.12 s wall time, peak RSS 56.3 MB vs 57.0 MB (∆ 0.7 MB), CPU <0.05 s user/<0.02 s system per run.

## Decision

PASS — ready for PO

- Functionality meets acceptance criteria; parity maintained for OpenAI tool-calling streams.
- PERF-4201 benchmarking follow-up completed (usage buffering adds ≤0.8 MB RSS and negligible CPU).

## Evidence Reviewed

| Category    | Evidence                                                                                                                           |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Unit        | `npm run test:unit` (covers aggregator UTF-8 buffering and helper logic)                                                           |
| Integration | `npm run test:integration -- chat.contract.streaming.int.test.js` (parallel & sequential tool-call transcripts)                    |
| Playwright  | `npm test` (SSE contract coverage including tool-call deltas and usage)                                                            |
| Artifacts   | `npm run transcripts:generate`; `node scripts/smoke/stream-tool-call.js --include-usage`; `node scripts/smoke/stream-tool-call.js` |
| Docs        | `docs/openai-chat-completions-parity.md`, `docs/bmad/stories/4.2.streaming-tool-call-blocks.md` (status/tasks updated)             |

## Traceability

- Requirements coverage verified against `docs/bmad/qa/assessments/4.2-test-design-20250924.md` (13 scenarios, 9× P0).
- Risks tracked in `docs/bmad/qa/assessments/4.2-risk-20250924.md`; TECH-4201/4202 mitigated via shared aggregator + UTF-8 buffering; OPS-4201 addressed by smoke harness workflow.
- PERF-4201 benchmarking resolved with usage on/off envelope logged in Dev Notes and gate.

## Follow-ups

1. Monitor Langfuse telemetry for `tool_call_index`, `delta_position`, and `usage_emitted` flags during canary to ensure aggregator health (owner: DevOps).
