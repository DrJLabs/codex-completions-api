# QA Review Summary

- Validated AC1–AC4 against new unit coverage (`tests/unit/metadata-sanitizer.spec.js`, `tests/unit/config.metadata.spec.js`) and the dedicated integration suite (`tests/integration/chat.nonstream.metadata.int.test.js`) exercising toggle on/off plus usage logging evidence.
- Confirmed helper-based implementation sanitizes telemetry without mutating tool/function payloads; logging includes `metadata_sanitizer_enabled`, `sanitized_metadata_count`, and `sanitized_metadata_keys` for observability.
- Reviewed configuration surface (`src/config/index.js`, `.env.example`) and documentation/story updates to ensure rollout guidance accompanies the new toggle.
- Risk matrix from `docs/bmad/qa/assessments/5.1-risk-20250926.md` recalculated: DATA-5101 mitigated via helper + tests; OPS-5102 addressed by usage log telemetry.
- Diff inspected for potential regressions: sanitizer isolated to non-stream handler, fake proto shim updated for deterministic metadata payloads, and no changes to streaming flow (not in scope).

## Decision

PASS — ready for PO review

- Acceptance criteria satisfied with full automated coverage; security objective (redacting rollout telemetry) achieved under toggle control.
- No open defects; roll-forward plan hinges on enabling `PROXY_SANITIZE_METADATA` during staged rollout per Dev Notes.

## Evidence Reviewed

| Category    | Evidence                                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Unit        | `npm run test:unit` (includes sanitizer + config toggle suites)                                                                                                  |
| Integration | `npm run test:integration -- chat.nonstream.metadata.int.test.js` (executes full integration pack and metadata-focused tests)                                    |
| Code        | `src/handlers/chat/nonstream.js`, `src/lib/metadata-sanitizer.js`, `src/config/index.js`, `.env.example`, `scripts/fake-codex-proto.js`                          |
| Docs        | `docs/bmad/stories/5.1.nonstream-metadata-sanitizer.md`, `docs/bmad/qa/assessments/5.1-test-design-20250926.md`, `docs/bmad/qa/assessments/5.1-risk-20250926.md` |

## Traceability

- Cross-checked against `docs/bmad/qa/assessments/5.1-test-design-20250926.md` (9 planned scenarios, all executed) and new trace matrix `docs/bmad/qa/assessments/5.1-trace-20250926.md` (4/4 ACs fully covered).
- Risk items DATA-5101 and OPS-5102 have direct mitigations: helper parsing + usage telemetry allow operators to audit sanitized keys; no residual high risks identified.

## Follow-ups

1. Coordinate with DevOps to enable `PROXY_SANITIZE_METADATA=true` in staging once release is deployed and monitor the new usage fields for unexpected keys (owner: Dev / DevOps).
2. Plan follow-on story to extend sanitizer to streaming responses using the shared helper to maintain parity (owner: Product/Dev).
