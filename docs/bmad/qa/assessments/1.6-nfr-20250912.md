## Scope

Assess non‑functional requirements impacted by Phase 5 cleanup: security, performance, reliability, and maintainability. No external API changes are intended; logging and bootstrap refactors should be neutral.

## Security

- Objective: No leakage of sensitive payloads at info level; auth gates unchanged.
- Controls: `src/middleware/access-log.js` logs only metadata fields; `WWW-Authenticate` on 401 unchanged; Bearer checks remain in chat/completions handlers.
- Evidence: Code inspection; integration tests for 401/headers; new access‑log test confirms only expected fields.
- Result: PASS.

## Performance

- Objective: No measurable regression vs baseline for non‑stream latency and stream TTFC.
- Guidance (advisory thresholds):
  - Non‑stream p95 latency ≤ 5s (unchanged from prior), and within ±5% of baseline on dev hardware.
  - Stream TTFC p95 ≤ 2s and within ±5% of baseline.
  - Logging overhead per request negligible (< ~2 ms avg, amortized; best‑effort observation via integration runs).
- Evidence: Integration/E2E suites green; no additional serialization introduced in hot paths.
- Result: PASS (advisory monitoring; no regressions observed locally).

## Reliability

- Objective: Stable behavior for idle timeouts and graceful shutdown.
- Controls: Existing `PROTO_IDLE_MS` and `PROXY_STREAM_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` tests; added thin bootstrap with SIGINT/SIGTERM handlers.
- Evidence: tests/integration/timeout.nonstream.int.test.js, tests/integration/stream.idle.int.test.js.
- Gap: No explicit SIGTERM test; optional follow‑up recommended.
- Result: PASS with Advisory (add graceful shutdown test optional).

## Maintainability

- Objective: Clear module boundaries; minimal `server.js`; usage helpers routed.
- Evidence: server.js is thin; usage moved to `src/routes/usage.js`; architecture docs updated.
- Result: PASS.

## Conclusion

- Decision: PASS (no NFR blockers).
- Follow‑ups (optional):
  - Add graceful shutdown test exercising SIGTERM.
  - Keep perf smoke script watching TTFC and non‑stream p95; alert on >5% drift.
