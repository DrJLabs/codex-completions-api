## Purpose

Outline current (September 2025) testing design practices that balance accuracy, automation, and manageable complexity for a solo developer stewarding the Codex Completions API.

## Key Findings

1. Modern JavaScript test stacks emphasize converged runners (Vitest, Playwright) with built-in component support, parallelism, and snapshot tooling to raise signal without bespoke harnesses.citeturn1search0
2. Recent Playwright guidance highlights lightweight accuracy boosters—such as selective tracing, deterministic fixtures, and worker-scoped configuration—that improve failure triage without inflating maintenance burden.citeturn2search0
3. Small-team best practices continue to center on incremental automation, environment parity, and disciplined regression gates; roadmap items should phase in improvements so a single maintainer can execute them.citeturn3search0
4. Targeted test selection research (T-TS) showcases ML-driven prioritization for async bugs, but the underlying logistic-regression pipeline introduces implementation and data complexity that may exceed solo capacity unless productized by tooling vendors.citeturn4search0

## Recommended Adjustments for Story 4.1 Test Design

- Incorporate Playwright’s worker-level fixtures and per-test tracing as optional toggles in the Story 4.1 E2E scenario, defaulting to `on-first-retry` capture so failures stay actionable without full-run overhead.citeturn2search0
- Extend the tooling baseline to track Vitest’s snapshot diffing and coverage reports now shipping out-of-the-box, reinforcing non-stream vs. stream parity assertions without custom reporters.citeturn1search0
- Document a pragmatic test-selection heuristic (e.g., diff-based + affected module mapping) as a near-term substitute for ML-based prioritization, noting T-TS as a future exploration if SaaS support emerges.citeturn3search0turn4search0

| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Vitest       | Enable `vitest run --coverage` in CI once per nightly build; keep local default fast (`vitest --changed`).                                                       | M      | Uses built-in coverage; avoids bespoke Istanbul wiring.citeturn1search0 |
| Playwright   | Adopt test annotations (`test.describe.configure({ mode: "parallel" })`) and `trace:on-first-retry` to improve flaky reproduction without full-time tracing.     | M      | Aligns with current best-practice guide.citeturn2search0                |
| Workflow     | Stage automation upgrades sequentially (formatting, lint cache, test runner flags) to respect solo bandwidth; lean on checklists from prior modernization issue. | S      | Mirrors small-team rollout advice.citeturn3search0                      |
| Future Watch | Monitor availability of turnkey targeted-test-selection services before attempting homegrown ML scoring.                                                         | L      | Research indicates non-trivial data/infra lift.citeturn4search0         |

## Next Steps

1. Update Story 4.1 test design baseline with the above adjustments (completed in this branch).citeturn1search0turn2search0turn3search0turn4search0
2. Prepare a concise delta summary for the Product Owner agent, requesting story draft validation once documentation is merged.
