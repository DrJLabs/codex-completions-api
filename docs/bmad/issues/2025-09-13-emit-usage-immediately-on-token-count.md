title: P1 â€” Emit usage immediately when token_count arrives (#73)

Current streaming handler defers usage emission to `task_complete`. To preserve partial/errored stream behavior, emit a usage chunk as soon as counts arrive (and/or on teardown) in addition to the finalizer path. See GH issue for context.
