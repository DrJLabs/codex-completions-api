Strengthen tag/release/backup strategy with immutable registry-backed snapshots, commit-aware tags, retention/prune, optional `.codex-api` data snapshot, CI publish, and supply-chain artifacts (SBOM/signatures). See GitHub issue for full scope, acceptance, and tasks.

## Resolution Notes (2025-09-22)

- Delivered via PR #94 (`feat/release-backup-hardening`) and merged to `main`.
- Release/backup scripts and docs landed as part of Story 3.10. GitHub Actions jobs now publish release bundles and run the `keploy-dry-run` replay step.
- The Keploy job currently logs `ERROR No test-sets found...` while succeeding; follow-up tracked alongside Story 3.6/Issue #77 and Issue `docs/bmad/issues/2025-09-22-keploy-dry-run-replay-gap.md` to reconcile the replay configuration.
