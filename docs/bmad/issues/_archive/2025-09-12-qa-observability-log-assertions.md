## Context

Story 1.5 passed with a minor concern: observability assertions for structured access-log fields are not explicitly covered by tests. Current logging middleware remains unchanged but lacked explicit test assertions.

## Resolution

- Implemented tests/integration/access-log.int.test.js asserting `req_id`, `route`, `status`, `dur_ms` and X-Request-Id correlation.
- Integration suite green (23 passed, 2 skipped). Gate for Story 1.6 set to PASS.
- See: docs/bmad/qa/gates/1.6-phase-5-cleanup-and-logging.yml

This issue is archived for traceability.
