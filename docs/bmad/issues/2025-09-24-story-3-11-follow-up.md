## Context

We are temporarily pausing work on Story 3.11 — QA SIGTERM Graceful Shutdown Test in order to focus on Epic — Chat Completions Canonical Parity. The story remains in Draft status and will need to be revisited once the parity epic lands.

## Goal

Resume Story 3.11 after the canonical parity epic ships, finalize its deliverables, and close the stability hardening follow-up.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Epic — Chat Completions Canonical Parity is completed or handoff milestones are met.
2. Story 3.11 is brought to Ready for Dev/QA with fresh architecture context review.
3. Updated tasks incorporate any new streaming/tooling learnings from the canonical parity epic.
4. Story 3.11 status moves from Draft to Ready (or Done) with linked evidence.

## Tasks

- [ ] Review the new streaming parity reference (docs/bmad/research/2025-09-24-openai-chat-completions-streaming-reference.md) for relevant insights.
- [ ] Re-open the Scrum Master workflow for Story 3.11 and update acceptance criteria if needed.
- [ ] Coordinate scheduling once Epic — Chat Completions Canonical Parity is closed.
- [ ] Document completion in Story 3.11 change log and close this issue.

## Notes

Track this item in sprint planning following completion of the canonical parity epic to avoid letting stability regressions linger.
