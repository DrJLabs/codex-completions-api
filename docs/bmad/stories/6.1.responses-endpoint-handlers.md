title: Story 6.1 — Responses Endpoint Handlers
status: Done
version: 1.0
updated: 2025-10-28
epic: docs/bmad/stories/epic-responses-endpoint-parity.md
labels: [api, responses, parity]

## Status

Done — `/v1/responses` now ships alongside chat handlers with shared utilities, typed SSE parity, refreshed transcripts, PASS QA gate, and PO sign-off.

## Story

**As a** Codex proxy maintainer,  
**I want** to expose `/v1/responses` using shared handler utilities that mirror the OpenAI contract,  
**so that** clients can adopt the Responses API with identical envelopes while preserving existing chat completions behavior.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `POST /v1/responses` (non-stream) returns the canonical envelope (`id`, `status`, `output[]`, `usage`, tool outputs, `previous_response_id`) matching the golden transcript specification, sharing model normalization and metadata sanitization with chat handlers.

2. Streaming requests (`stream: true`) emit typed SSE events (`response.created`, `response.output_text.delta`, `response.output_text.done`, `response.completed`, `done`) with optional usage payloads when `stream_options.include_usage` is set, reusing the global concurrency guard and keepalive policies.

3. Shared handler utilities ensure both `/v1/responses` and `/v1/chat/completions` honor sanitizer toggles, tool-tail controls, and fail-fast behavior (timeouts, invalid `n`, model checks) without regressions to existing endpoints.

4. Automated coverage (unit, integration, Playwright) is updated so parity tests compare responses and chat completions transcripts, failing CI on any divergence from `docs/openai-endpoint-golden-parity.md`.

## Dev Notes

- **Previous Story Insights:** Epic 6 has no completed stories; reuse established chat handler patterns and sanitizer tooling introduced in Stories 5.1–5.3 to minimize divergence.  
  [Source: docs/bmad/architecture.md#post-v1-chat-completions--non-stream; docs/bmad/stories/5.3.telemetry-and-documentation-updates.md#dev-notes]
- **Data Models:** Responses piggyback on existing Codex JSONL events and usage NDJSON records; telemetry schema (`UsageLogEvent`, `ProtoEvent`) remains unchanged.  
  [Source: docs/bmad/architecture.md#data-models-and-telemetry-records]
- **API Specifications:** Follow documented lifecycles for chat non-stream/stream and newly defined responses endpoints to maintain parity envelopes and SSE sequencing.  
  [Source: docs/bmad/architecture.md#post-v1-responses-non-stream; docs/bmad/architecture.md#post-v1-responses-stream-typed-sse; docs/bmad/architecture.md#post-v1-chat-completions--stream-sse]
- **Component Specifications:** SSE utilities (`src/services/sse.js`) and concurrency guard service must be reused for typed event emission and resource management.  
  [Source: docs/bmad/architecture/source-tree.md#src-modules; docs/bmad/architecture.md#rate-limiting--concurrency-guard]
- **File Locations:** Route lives under `src/routes`, handlers under `src/handlers`, shared utilities under `src/handlers/shared`, and transcript scripts under `scripts/`.  
  [Source: docs/bmad/architecture/source-tree.md#src-modules; docs/bmad/architecture/source-tree.md#scripts--ops]
- **Testing Requirements:** Update Vitest unit/integration suites and Playwright E2E per tech stack guidance; ensure CI continues running `npm run verify:all`.  
  [Source: docs/bmad/architecture/tech-stack.md#testing--qa]
- **Technical Constraints:** Maintain Node.js ≥22 ESM-only code style, Express 4.19 patterns, and avoid introducing new dependencies without PM/architect approval.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-27

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

- Parity transcripts now cover minimal, tool-call, and chained-response flows; the helper layer keeps IDs and usage in sync with chat. Negative-path regressions (metadata sanitizer toggles, idle timeout, concurrency guard saturation, stop-after-tools) still live only in responses-specific suites, so future refactors must preserve both sets.
- Streaming adapter surfaces typed SSE events (`response.created`, deltas, completion, done) and now emits usage when requested, but there is no test coverage for streaming tool deltas or client abort handling.
- Shared utilities reuse chat logic effectively; however, maintaining two near-identical test matrices increases maintenance overhead unless suites are deduplicated via shared helpers.

### Tests Reviewed

- `tests/unit/responses.shared.spec.js`
- `tests/integration/responses.contract.nonstream.int.test.js`
- `tests/integration/responses.contract.streaming.int.test.js`
- `tests/integration/responses.nonstream.metadata.int.test.js`

- `tests/integration/responses.stream.concurrency.int.test.js`
- `tests/integration/responses.stream.tools.int.test.js`
- `tests/integration/responses.error.invalid-n.int.test.js`
- `tests/e2e/responses-contract.spec.js`

### Findings

- Failure-mode parity is still incomplete: streaming tool-call deltas, abort-driven guard cleanup, and sanitizer toggles via Playwright remain untested. Responses coverage relies on fake Codex modes; real Codex behaviours (mixed deltas, usage suppression) should be validated before GA.

### Recommendations

1. Add responses streaming tests that exercise tool delta aggregation, including parallel tool-call fragments, to prove `tool_use` nodes are emitted correctly.
2. Port the Playwright metadata sanitizer toggle suite to `/v1/responses` so browser-level paths validate sanitization.
3. Expand concurrency guard coverage to include forced abort scenarios, mirroring the chat kill-on-disconnect harness once it is unskipped.

### Review Date: 2025-10-27

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

- `src/handlers/responses/nonstream.js` and `src/handlers/responses/stream.js` reuse the chat pipeline while converting payloads through `src/handlers/responses/shared.js`, so tool-call outputs and chained `previous_response_id` flows now land in the canonical Responses envelope proved out by the refreshed transcripts.
- The streaming adapter in `src/handlers/responses/stream-adapter.js` captures typed SSE (`response.created`, `response.output_text.*`, `response.completed`, `done`) and aggregates tool deltas via `src/lib/tool-call-aggregator.js`, matching the parity fixtures under `test-results/responses/*.json`.
- Helper coverage in `tests/unit/responses.shared.spec.js` plus the updated contract suites (`tests/integration/responses.contract.*.int.test.js`, `tests/e2e/responses-contract.spec.js`) keep the new normalization logic under test while exercising tool-call and chained-response scenarios end-to-end.

### Tests Reviewed

- `tests/unit/responses.shared.spec.js`
- `tests/integration/responses.contract.nonstream.int.test.js`
- `tests/integration/responses.contract.streaming.int.test.js`
- `tests/integration/responses.error.invalid-n.int.test.js`
- `tests/e2e/responses-contract.spec.js`

### Findings

- Failure-mode parity is only partially proven: responses inherits the chat guardrails, yet there are no responses-specific regressions for timeouts, metadata sanitizer toggles, or concurrency guard saturation, so we still depend on inference rather than evidence.

### Recommendations

1. Port the chat negative-path suites (timeout, sanitizer toggle on/off, concurrency guard saturation) to `/v1/responses` to demonstrate behavioural parity under failure modes.
2. Add a responses streaming scenario that asserts `stream_options.include_usage` toggles usage and keeps emitting after tool cuts, matching `PROXY_STOP_AFTER_TOOLS` expectations.

### Gate Status

Gate: CONCERNS → [epic-responses-endpoint-parity.6.1-responses-endpoint-handlers.yml](../qa/gates/epic-responses-endpoint-parity.6.1-responses-endpoint-handlers.yml)

Recommended Next Status: Changes Required (close remaining failure-mode parity gaps).

### Review Date: 2025-10-28

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

- Streaming adapter now emits the typed Responses SSE lifecycle and folds tool-call deltas plus usage into the terminal envelope, matching the contract fixtures and tool aggregation logic in `src/handlers/responses/stream-adapter.js` and `src/handlers/responses/shared.js`.
- Kill-on-disconnect, concurrency guard, and timeout regressions are covered directly on `/v1/responses`, demonstrating parity with chat guardrails while reusing the shared chat pipeline underneath.
- Metadata sanitizer toggles now have both integration and Playwright coverage targeting `/v1/responses`, confirming redaction telemetry and token logs stay consistent with browser streaming behaviour.

### Tests Reviewed

- `tests/integration/responses.stream.tool-delta.int.test.js`
- `tests/integration/responses.kill-on-disconnect.int.test.js`
- `tests/integration/responses.stream.metadata.int.test.js`
- `tests/e2e/responses-stream-metadata.spec.ts`
- `tests/integration/responses.timeout.nonstream.int.test.js`

### Findings

- Coverage now spans the previously missing failure paths. The new regression verifying the default `include_usage` behaviour, plus freshly captured transcripts under `test-results/responses/` (see `node scripts/generate-responses-transcripts.mjs --codex /path/to/codex`), close the open parity gaps.

### Recommendations

- None.
