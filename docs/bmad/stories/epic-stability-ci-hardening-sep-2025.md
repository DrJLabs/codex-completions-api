# Epic

Our proxy is functionally aligned with OpenAI’s Chat Completions API, but a handful of high‑impact gaps and flaky behaviors remain. This epic focuses on urgent stabilization work that unblocks the dev edge environment, reduces CI flakiness, and locks in parity via golden/contract checks.

# Acceptance Criteria

1. Dev edge non‑stream POST to `/v1/chat/completions` returns within timeout with correct JSON, matching prod.
2. Non‑stream truncation case consistently returns `finish_reason:"length"` without socket errors; integration test is green and deterministic.
3. Streaming handler emits usage as soon as counts are known and always before `[DONE]` when requested, preserving behavior on early termination.
4. Streaming concurrency guard test deterministically returns 429 for the second stream at concurrency limit.
5. Golden transcripts + contract checks cover non‑stream and streaming order (role → content → finish_reason → usage? → `[DONE]`) and are integrated into CI.
6. All work captured below is linked and closed; docs updated where relevant.

# Phases & Tasks

- [x] Phase 0 — Contracts first (guardrails)
  - [x] Expand golden transcripts to include: minimal prompt, multi‑chunk content, truncation path; store under `test-results/` with clear naming. _(Story 3.5)_
  - [x] Add contract checks in integration/E2E to validate order: role → content… → finish*reason → usage? → `[DONE]`. *(Stories 3.5 & 3.6)\_

- [x] Phase 1 — Dev edge non‑stream timeout (P0)
  - [x] Reproduce on dev edge; confirm prod parity. Inspect Cloudflare/WAF, Traefik, and origin timeouts. _(Story 3.1)_
  - [x] Add tracing headers in dev for visibility; verify body fully flushes before connection close. _(Story 3.1)_
  - [x] Close GH #74 with evidence (cURL and Playwright smoke on dev domain). _(Story 3.1)_

- [x] Phase 2 — Non‑stream truncation flake
  - [x] Treat early proto `stdout.end` as truncation and return `finish_reason:"length"` immediately. _(Story 3.2)_
  - [x] Harden `tests/integration/chat.nonstream.length.int.test.js` for determinism. _(Story 3.2)_

- [x] Phase 3 — Streaming usage timing
  - [x] Emit usage as soon as counts arrive and on teardown; preserve finalizer order; keep `[DONE]` separate. _(Story 3.3)_
  - [x] Verify with Playwright stream collector and contract checks. _(Stories 3.3 & 3.6)_

- [x] Phase 4 — Concurrency guard determinism
  - [x] Add test‑only headers (`X-Conc-*`) for observability; adjust guard timing if needed.
  - [x] Ensure repeatable 429 on the second concurrent stream at limit.

- [x] Phase 5 — Docs & runbooks
  - [x] Update `docs/openai-chat-completions-parity.md` if order/toggles are clarified.
  - [x] Add a runbook snippet for dev edge timeouts (checks + usual culprits).

## Progress

- ✅ **Story 3.1–3.4** closed the non-stream timeout, truncation flake, usage emission, and concurrency guard gaps (Phases 1–4).
- ✅ **Story 3.5** delivered the expanded golden transcript corpus and contract guardrails (Phase 0) plus documentation updates.
- ✅ **Story 3.6** introduced Keploy-backed snapshots, CI toggles, and QA/PO artifacts; follow-up rollout tracked in `docs/bmad/issues/2025-09-20-keploy-install-config.md`.
- ✅ **Story 3.7** standardized Keploy CLI installation across CI and local dev, flipping `KEPLOY_ENABLED` and documenting the environment contract.
- ✅ **Story 3.8** captured replay evidence using self-hosted runner `codex-keploy-ci-01`, clearing the memlock blocker and archiving artefacts from CI runs #459–463.
- ✅ **Story 3.9** delivers richer streaming finish_reason parity, telemetry, and updated client guidance; remaining telemetry follow-ups were shelved for future observability work (`docs/bmad/issues/_archive/2025-09-22-finish-reason-follow-ups.md`).

## Close-out Summary — 2025-09-23

- Dev edge non-stream timeout resolved by tightening the dev-only guard (`PROXY_DEV_TRUNCATE_AFTER_MS=9000`); `npm run smoke:dev` now passes consistently with both non-stream and streaming checks.
- All linked issues are closed or archived under `docs/bmad/issues/_archive/`, with GitHub issues #73, #74, #77, and #80 closed alongside documentation updates.
- Keploy-related work is shelved indefinitely; references now point to archived notes while the live test matrix relies on JSON transcripts and contract tests.
- Remaining stretch items (release/backup hardening evidence, graceful shutdown test, finish_reason telemetry) are documented in the archive for potential future epics.

# Dependencies & Impact

- Issues: see Priorities section.
- Code: `src/handlers/chat/nonstream.js`, `src/handlers/chat/stream.js`, `src/services/sse.js`.
- Tests: `tests/integration/*`, Playwright E2E config, stream collector helper.
- Ops: Cloudflare/Traefik settings for dev edge.

# Rollout & Verification

- Local: `npm run verify:all` (unit, integration, e2e) — ensure newly added contract checks are green.
- Dev stack: `npm run dev:stack:up` → run `npm run smoke:dev`; validate dev edge non‑stream with cURL.
- Prod parity confirmation (no config flips): observe logs and run `npm run smoke:prod` after deploy when applicable.
