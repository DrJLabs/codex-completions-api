## Status

Done — 2025-09-20 (merged to main; Keploy CLI rollout tracked in docs/bmad/issues/2025-09-20-keploy-install-config.md)

### Follow-up Observation (2025-09-22)

- The downstream `keploy-dry-run` job currently reports `ERROR No test-sets found...` and therefore skips replaying the stored YAML fixtures. This indicates the CI invocation needs to be realigned with the snapshots under `test-results/chat-completions/keploy/test-set-0/tests`. Track the fix alongside Issue #77 to restore automated replay coverage.

Depends on: Story 3.5 — Golden Transcripts & Contract Checks (Done 2025-09-19).

## Research Insights

- Integrating Keploy snapshot capture replaces the bespoke transcript recorder so CI and local runs share deterministic mocks for chat parity. [Source: docs/bmad/issues/2025-09-19-keploy-snapshot-ci.md]
- Keploy 3.0 introduces instrumentation-free snapshot capture via the `keploy` proxy and config-driven `keploy.yml`, enabling selective recording, sanitization filters, and record/test toggles that align with CI pipelines. citeturn0search0turn0search1turn1search0
- GitHub Actions guidance demonstrates running Keploy in dedicated record/test jobs with explicit `KEPLOY_MODE` settings, isolated service containers, and artifact uploads for reports, informing our workflow design. citeturn0search2
- The tech stack roadmap already earmarks Keploy 3.0 for GitHub Actions and dev Docker images, making it a first-class dependency in `npm run verify:all`. [Source: docs/bmad/architecture/tech-stack.md#Testing & QA]
- Golden transcript artifacts capture non-stream, truncation, and streaming usage scenarios under `test-results/chat-completions/` with sanitized metadata that new snapshots must preserve. [Source: docs/openai-chat-completions-parity.md#Golden Transcripts & Snapshots]
- Transcript tooling and contract suites live under `scripts/` and `tests/`, so Keploy integration must slot into the existing structure without relocating assets. [Source: docs/bmad/architecture/source-tree.md#Scripts & Ops]
- Integration, Playwright, and end-to-end coverage run through shared commands defined by the architecture guide; any Keploy hook must keep the suite green within current budgets. [Source: docs/bmad/architecture.md#Tests & Coverage (high-level)]

## Story

As a QA automation engineer, I want to integrate Keploy snapshot capture into our transcript pipeline and CI so that contract tests replay deterministic HTTP mocks without relying on custom recorders.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. CI runners and dev stack images install Keploy 3.0 CLI/daemon, expose required environment variables (e.g., `KEPLOY_ENABLED`), and document setup steps for local developers. [Source: docs/bmad/issues/2025-09-19-keploy-snapshot-ci.md]
2. `scripts/generate-chat-transcripts.mjs` (or successor) can toggle between inline recording and Keploy record/test workflows, keeping metadata fields (`commit`, `codex_bin`, scenario tags) intact and delegating runtime options to a checked-in `keploy.yml` (service, filters, record/test policy). [Source: docs/bmad/issues/2025-09-19-keploy-snapshot-ci.md; docs/openai-chat-completions-parity.md#Golden Transcripts & Snapshots] citeturn0search0turn1search0
3. Baseline Keploy snapshots exist for minimal non-stream, non-stream truncation, and streaming usage scenarios, stored under `test-results/chat-completions/` with sanitized IDs/timestamps identical to current transcripts. [Source: docs/bmad/issues/2025-09-19-keploy-snapshot-ci.md; docs/openai-chat-completions-parity.md#Golden Transcripts & Snapshots]
4. `npm run verify:all` executes integration and Playwright contract suites against Keploy replays when enabled, falling back to inline captures when Keploy is absent, and the pipeline maintains existing runtime budgets. [Source: docs/bmad/issues/2025-09-19-keploy-snapshot-ci.md; docs/bmad/architecture/tech-stack.md#Testing & QA]
5. Documentation and runbooks describe Keploy step monitoring (duration, failure signals) and Story 3.5’s issue is updated with snapshot instructions and evidence linking to the new artifacts. [Source: docs/bmad/issues/2025-09-19-keploy-snapshot-ci.md; docs/bmad/architecture.md#Observability]
6. CI pipelines define explicit Keploy record and test stages (with cacheable artifacts and report uploads) following current GitHub Actions best practices for containerized services. citeturn0search2

## Dev Notes

- Previous Story Insights:
  - Story 3.5 shipped the transcript generator, golden fixtures, and contract suites that this integration must reuse when swapping in Keploy capture/replay. [Source: docs/bmad/stories/3.5.golden-transcripts-contract-checks.md#Dev Agent Record]
- Data Models:
  - No specific guidance found in architecture docs.
- API Specifications:
  - Golden transcript checks enforce `/v1/chat/completions` parity for non-stream and streaming flows; Keploy mocks must match those envelopes. [Source: docs/openai-chat-completions-parity.md#Golden Transcripts & Snapshots]
- Component Specifications:
  - Transcript scripts, integration suites, and Playwright specs are the sanctioned surfaces for parity enforcement; Keploy wiring should remain within those modules. [Source: docs/bmad/architecture/source-tree.md#Scripts & Ops]
  - Keploy 3.0 runs as a proxy defined in `keploy.yml`, so CI jobs must launch the proxy alongside the Node service and respect record/test toggles. citeturn0search0turn0search1
- File Locations:
  - Keep artifacts under `test-results/chat-completions/` with sanitized metadata placeholders to retain deterministic diffs. [Source: docs/openai-chat-completions-parity.md#Golden Transcripts & Snapshots]
- Testing Requirements:
  - Maintain `npm run verify:all` coverage (format, lint, unit, integration, Playwright) while adding Keploy replay hooks. [Source: docs/bmad/architecture/tech-stack.md#Testing & QA]
  - Adopt the record → test job pattern recommended for GitHub Actions, archiving Keploy reports for debugging CI failures. citeturn0search2
- Technical Constraints:
  - Respect existing configuration knobs (`PROXY_CODEX_WORKDIR`, `CODEX_HOME`, SSE timeouts) when introducing Keploy processes so sandbox behavior stays consistent. [Source: docs/bmad/architecture.md#Configuration Surface]
- Project Structure Notes:
  - All changes remain within established `scripts/`, `tests/`, and `docs/` directories; no structural adjustments are required. [Source: docs/bmad/architecture/source-tree.md#Top-Level]

## Testing

- `npm run verify:all` to exercise formatting, linting, unit, integration, and Playwright suites with Keploy enabled. [Source: docs/bmad/architecture/tech-stack.md#Testing & QA]
- `npx vitest run tests/integration/chat.contract.streaming.int.test.js` (or targeted contract suites) with Keploy replay to validate streaming paths. [Source: docs/bmad/architecture/tech-stack.md#Testing & QA]
- `npm test` to run Playwright SSE contract specs under Keploy-backed fixtures. [Source: docs/bmad/architecture/tech-stack.md#Testing & QA]

## QA Results

- Pending — QA to produce risk, test design, traceability, and gate artifacts once implementation stabilizes.
