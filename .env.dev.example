# DEV-only safeguard: early finalize non-stream if backend is slow (ms; 0=disabled)
# Avoids Cloudflare 524 by returning finish_reason:"length" before the 100s no-bytes window

# Codex CLI selection (dev stack)
# - Default in compose.dev.stack.yml is CODEX_BIN=codex (real Codex CLI; requires ~/.cargo/bin/codex mounted)
# - To use the lightweight proto shim for offline tests, set:
# CODEX_BIN=/app/scripts/fake-codex-proto.js

# Model naming in dev vs prod
# - Dev advertises codev-5 and codev-5-{low,medium,high,minimal}
# - Prod advertises codex-5 and codex-5-{low,medium,high,minimal}
# Some clients validate against /v1/models and will reject the wrong prefix.
